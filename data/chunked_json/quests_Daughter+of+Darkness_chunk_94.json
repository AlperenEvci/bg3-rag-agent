I'd do it again, if the whim struck me\n\nSay it was not personal and if you have Minthara with you, she will approve. However, Dame Aylin will state she will not forget her actions, but will continue to consider you an ally. She will further introduce herself and state that she will join your camp.\n\nSee you there. I don't think so. Our journey together ends here. No need to wait.",
