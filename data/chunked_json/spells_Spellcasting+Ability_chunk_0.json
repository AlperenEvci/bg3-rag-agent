  "content": "In Baldur's Gate 3 Each class has a \"Spellcasting Ability\". This is the ability score used to determine how effective you spells are, and affects a number of things, including your number of spells prepared (if applicable), the Saving Throw Difficulty Class (DC) of your spells, and your spell attack modifier. Some spells add numerical effects based on your spellcasting ability, like the spell healing word which heals additional hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier.\n\nSpells in Baldur's ",
