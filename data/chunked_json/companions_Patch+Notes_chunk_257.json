  "content": " combat at the Last Light lakeside would end and no further waves would spawn. Made the combat at the Last Light lakeside trigger more consistently even if you're standing in odd positions. Balthazar should no longer occasionally stand idle, causing combat to halt within the Colony. Balthazar's reanimated skeletons in the Shadowfell now have Shove only in Tactician Mode. Increased the HP that the Undead Nurses resurrect at from 25% to 45% during the combat with Malus Thorm in Tactician and Honou",
