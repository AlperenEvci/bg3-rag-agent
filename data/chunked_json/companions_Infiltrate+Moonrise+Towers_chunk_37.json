  "content": " for a small chance of winning here is to use a protection spell on Isobel, while you dish out as much damage as you can on Marcus before he knocks Isobel out. Chances are, however, you’ll lose this fight due to Marcus’ sheer bulk and power. After he knocks out Isobel, all hell will break loose in the inn, resulting in the death of most of its inhabitants.\n\nThe shields will disappear, allowing the shadows to enter the inn and turn some into Enemies, while the others die to the horrors that enter",
