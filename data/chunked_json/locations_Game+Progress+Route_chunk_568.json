Make your way back to The Sluice Gate to reach Minsc and Clone Jaheira's hiding place.\n\nGo through the pipes and a cutscene will play where Roah Moonglow and Minsc are seen talking. They are talking about their plans and that they serve only The Absolute. Roah speaks about returning to The Guildhall to do their bidding. However, Minsc will spot your party from a distance",
