  "content": "tart the combat. Casting Dominate Person on Dolor before combat will no longer lead to all companions becoming enemies of the caster. Kled doesn't have Dror Ragzlin's Legendary Actions anymore. Dror's not one for sharing. Raphael's Infernal Salve spell will now only work on his allies who are also Fiends. The Wayward Undead condition will now get removed when combat ends, and the Undead entity will get destroyed when the condition is removed. The condition also now has an icon.\n\nFixed Micromodro",
