  "content": "Origins in Baldur's Gate 3 give the player the opportunity to play as a Custom (unique) character or a pre-made. BG3 Origins are thus essentially the equivalent of premade characters, each has its own background. Players can also choose Custom if they wish more flexibility in their Character Creation, but unique opportunities are only available to the premade Origins. This page covers all of the available Origin avatars or characters in Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Origins (Beginner Guide)\n",
