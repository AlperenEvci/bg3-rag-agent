In return for our help, she promised to release Wyll from his pact, but only after six months had passed. She disappeared again - but not before promising she'd find us soon enough.\n\nMizora will make a few appearances in Baldur's Gate once you reach the city in Act 3. You will progress after she gives you your next steps. Explore the City and carry on with your Main Quests. You",
