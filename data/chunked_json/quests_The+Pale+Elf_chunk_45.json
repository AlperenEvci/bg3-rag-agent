We should look for them in the taverns and flophouses of Wyrm's Crossing.\n\nAs you progress through Act 3, you look out for these key events that will update the quest journals. Once you make your way to the Lower City, you can look for the Palace and make your way in for the next objective. The entrance to the Szarr Palace South Tower is located near the Lower City waypoint. (X:-68; Y:-53.)",
