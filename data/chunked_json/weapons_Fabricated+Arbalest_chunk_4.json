  "content": "otes & Tips for BG3\n\nRarity: Very Rare Value: 960 Weight: 8.1 There are two actions called Dazzling Ray listed on the Fabricated Arbalest item, but only the weapon action is given, not the class action. Dazzling Ray woks the same as Sunbeam, just with less damage and with a chance to damage the caster. Like many unique versions of spells given by weapons, it incorrectly states that you need to be proficient in the weapon to use the action, you don't. The weapon can be equipped by anyone and both",
