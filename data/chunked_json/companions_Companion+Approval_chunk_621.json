This is a sensitive matter.\" Follow her and talk to her in the chapel and say, \"Change of plan. I'm going to kill you.\" Demand boots in the dialogue with Tulla ( in the Underdark, mushrooms camp). Agree to kill dark dwarfs for “mushrooms” leader. Do not excuse for using the power of Tadpoles ( dialogue with the party at the Camp). Tell Abdirak you're curious and agree to be tortured",
