Warlocks will most likely Multiclass after level 3 or level 9, depending on what class they are multiclassing, since they are very front-loaded. Warlock Spell Slots don't level up any higher when multiclassing, so if you want stronger Spell Slots you'll need to keep taking levels in Warlock. Warlocks can wear Medium Armour and use a Shield and still cast spells if they have Proficiency in these from their Race or other ",
