  "content": "is a magical scimitar that adds the spellcasting modifier instead of dexterity to its attacks. In BG3, each type of weapon has different ranges, damages, and other features (Finesse, Versatile, Dippable, etc.). Characters need to master certain Proficiency before using a weapon, and sometimes gain special Actions while holding it.\n\nEverything moves strangely in the Feywild from rivers to behaviours. It's a mercurial place, where the magical and physical can pass permeably through one another.\n\nB",
