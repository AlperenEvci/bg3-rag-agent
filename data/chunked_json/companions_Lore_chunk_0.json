  "content": "Lore for Baldur's Gate 3 covers the basic aspects of the world of D&D that are touched on in the game. Keep in mind that whilst BG3 is a sequel to BG 1 and BG2, not all concepts are visited and the world of D&D is incredibly complex.\n\nIs BG3 a sequel to Baldur's Gate 1 and 2?\n\nYes. The story takes place 100 years after the events in Baldur’s Gate 2 and shortly after the events of Descent into Avernus. We don’t want to spoil anything about the story but it will be connected to the previous games ",
