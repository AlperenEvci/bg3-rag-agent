This gives you all the advantages of a DEX Monk while using STR as a dump stat without any downsides. For Monks, if your STR is higher than your DEX, your bonuses will be STR + STR, but if your DEX is higher, the bonuses will be STR + DEX.\n\nAll Feats in Baldur's Gate 3 Ability Improvements ♦ Actor ♦ Alert ♦ Athlete ♦ Charger ♦ Crossbow Expert ♦ Defensive Duellist",
