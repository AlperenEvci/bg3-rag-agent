  "content": "ldur's Gate 3's Combat mechanics are heavily inspired by Dungeons & Dragons. To put it simply, dice rolls determine how successful you are in performing actions during combat. In more detail, the game features a robust and dynamic combat system that combines aspects of turn-based combat with real-time action. Like in Divinity: Original Sin II, players can freely move their characters during exploration, and when approaching an enemy encounter, the game seamlessly transitions into turn-based comb",
