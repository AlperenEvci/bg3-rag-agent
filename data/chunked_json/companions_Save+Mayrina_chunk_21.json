  "content": "unless you tell her about the wand through the first option, Save Mayrina will not end. If you use the wand on Connor, he will get resurrected as a Zombie. You can then choose to keep the wand and it's 'resurrection powers' or give the wand to Mayrina, who'll find a way to restore her husband fully. Either way, the quest will end here. If you give the wand to Mayrina, Gale and Wyll will approve. (Warning: Giving Mayrina the wand will break a Paladin's Oath, if they chose the Oath of the Ancients",
