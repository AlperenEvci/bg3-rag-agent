Perhaps we can find a way to free her.\n\nTalk to the half-elf.\n\nOnce you have the Eldritch Rune return to the pod in which Shadowheart is trapped and insert the rune into the console located on its right side. If you successfully pass the dice roll check then Shadowheart will get out of the capsule and you will be able to talk to her.\n\nRescue the Illit",
