The Grym is resistant or immune to almost every type of damage and it has a large pool of life, so it's not recommended to combat against it directly.\n\nThe best way to defeat the Grym, is to bait it to walk over the crucible, and pull the lever that hammers it. Prepare your party for the battle before rising the level",
