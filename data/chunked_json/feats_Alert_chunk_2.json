  "content": "r will get more use out of the feat than one with very high Dexterity given the latter is likely to go very early in the initiative order even without Alert. Ideal to get on Shadowheart, or any Cleric with low DEX. This will allow them to go first and cast Bless before their first attack if you fail to precast it. The Level 7 Barbarian feature Feral Instinct, makes you immune to Surprise similar to Alert, making this feat less optimal. Works while in Druid Wild Shape.\n\nAll Feats in Baldur's Gate",
