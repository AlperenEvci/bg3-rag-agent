  "content": "s expected during the Early Access stage, saves made during Early Access will not be compatible with the full version of the game when it releases.\n\nIs there going to be a perma-death option in BG3 similar to D&D?\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3 you can select Honour mode, in this mode you only gets a single save file for the entire campaign. If the party dies, the player is presented with two choices, continue the campaign in Custom mode, which ends Honour mode. Or end the campaign, which deletes the save.",
