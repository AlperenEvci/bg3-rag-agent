  "content": " you're playing as Karlach, you'll no longer miraculously come back to the Elfsong after burning out or going to Avernus after defeating the Netherbrain when you have multiple romantic partners. Fixed a bug causing you to get stuck in the Elfsong camp. Fixed a flow issue where if Halsin was your romance partner and you chose to go with him at the end of the game, during the epilogue he would act as though you didn't. Fixed a wrong check issue that would prevent Shadowheart from saving her parent",
