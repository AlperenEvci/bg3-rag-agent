  "content": "ocked in combat if your character was Downed but not dead when Isobel was killed. Fixed a bug where you could get locked in combat with Cazador if Astarion was alive and incapacitated in his ritual position, one of the other spawn was dead, and the rest of the party was defeated by Cazador. Now combat ends correctly with a Game Over screen. Fixed a potential crash when leaving the Iron Throne combat. Fixed a bug where you could get stuck under the elevator in the Colony, blocking progress. Fixed",
