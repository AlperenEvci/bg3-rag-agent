  "content": "have only 6 turns to extract as many prisoners as possible. Dimensional door, and Teleportation Circle spells are very helpful, as well as Potion of Speed. Omeluum is also kept here in the furthest corner. Send one of your tank teammate to rescue him, and draw the attention of Sahuagin. Omeluum has a special spell that can teleport himself and one extra back to the sub, so don't worry about the time. Escort duke Ravengard and Gondians to the sub, then talk to Zanner Toobin to complete the quest.",
