  "content": "r dice used are d4, d8, d10, d12 and d20.\n\nDeath Saving Throws\n\nWhen a character's HP reaches 0, they must roll a die to stay alive (Death Saving Throw). The character rolls a die each turn. Each roll either succeeds or fails. After three successes, the character is stabilized. After three failures, the character is dead. Characters can be saved by their allies by being healed, or if someone uses the Help action on them during Death Saving Throws. Stabilized characters still need an ally to use ",
