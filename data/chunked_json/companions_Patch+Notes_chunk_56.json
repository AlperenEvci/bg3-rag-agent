  "content": "ed a bug causing the upcasted version of Grasping Vine to cost an Action instead of a Bonus Action. The Forbidden Knowledge passive now works with Wisdom Skill Checks as well as Wisdom Saving Throws, as intended. Updated Mind Sanctuary and Grease to not target items through walls. Fixed Harper Skywin having Strength-based stats, which wasn't appropriate for her Dexterity-based build. Fixed an Undead Harper in the Shadow-Cursed Lands looking like Harper Skywin's identical twin. Nothing to see her",
