Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.\n\nEARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE\n\nIn",
