  "content": "ation. Tooltips now indicate when spells and actions need an Attack Roll and show details about that roll. Tooltips now clearly indicate if a spell requires a Saving Throw from the target. Added AoE to embedded tooltips. Barbarian actions that require Rage now warn you when the barbarian doesn't have Rage. Wrote the Skittish (previously Easily Frightened) passive. Made it easier to see the 'Available only when Raging' warning for Diving Strike. Added descriptions for Darkness clouds and Ash surf",
