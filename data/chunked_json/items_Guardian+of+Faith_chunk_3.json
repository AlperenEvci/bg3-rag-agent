It's guarding the Ceremonial Battleaxe, which can be used as part of the Blood of Lathander questline. The Guardian synergises well with other summons; which can be ordered to walk in and out of an enemy's melee range to provoke an Attack of Opportunity (from the enemy). The Guardian will then attempt to counter the AoO if it is within range.\n\nLvl 4",
