  "content": " client was connected.\n\nFixed the tooltip for Detect Thoughts in dialogues showing a Wisdom roll instead of an Intelligence roll. Fixed some visible placeholder text for Kar'niss' Spindleweb Sanctuary spell. Fixed some spell tooltips incorrectly indicating that they trigger a Saving Throw. The tooltip for the Cursed Imp's Ray of Sickness spell will now indicate the spell level and school. Added Evasion modifiers to the tooltips in the combat log for monks. Improved the clarity of the calculation",
