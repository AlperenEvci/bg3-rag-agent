  "content": " Fixed an issue where attempting a skill check against Kar'niss could occasionally cause the dialogue to end abruptly. Fixed an issue causing avatar Origin characters in a party with a Dark Urge character to potentially turn hostile along with other companions during a Dark Urge event at night in Act II if the Dark Urge character fails to persuade them that they are not responsible for the murder. Also fixed avatars that were broken in this way, including dead avatars that can't be resurrected. ",
