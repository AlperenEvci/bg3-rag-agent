Toobin died, and can no longer help us destroy the Foundry. We reached the heart of the Steel Watch Foundry - the Neurocitor. If we use Wulbren's runepowder bomb on it, it should be enough to destroy the Foundry. We no longer have Wulbren's runepowder bomb. We need to find another way to destroy the Foundry.\n\nQuest Complete Descriptions\n\n",
