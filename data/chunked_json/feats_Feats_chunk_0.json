  "content": "Feats in Baldur's Gate 3 are special talents or areas of expertise that provide special capabilities to characters. Each Feat is unique, giving you an extra passive or active skill that you would not have gotten otherwise through your chosen Class or Backgrounds. These Feats can range from increases in Ability Scores, to proficiencies that give you an edge in battle, to skill bonuses that are best suited for out-of-combat scenarios. Feats can help cover up any weaknesses your character may have,",
