This includes the Idol of Silvanus, allowing for easy completion of Steal the Sacred Idol if the quest was obtained beforehand, rewarding Ring of Protection. Various keys (Kagha's Key; if the Druids turn against the Tieflings and begin killing each other, multiple Storage Keys and the Prison Key may be found on select Tiefling corpses should they die in the conflict, such as Zorru, Guex, and Ikaron)",
