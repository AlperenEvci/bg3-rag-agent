  "content": "Drow presents a dark elven race with a history of conflict between the two Elven deities. After Lolth was found guilty of high treachery, she was banished into the Underdark by her own elven kind, where she conquered the deep abyss and regained powers for herself. After millennia of war between the elves that caused endless bloody conflict, the other Elves have decided to turn all the Dark Elves, indiscriminately, into \"Drow\", into what they are today in Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nLolth-Sworn Drow\n\n",
