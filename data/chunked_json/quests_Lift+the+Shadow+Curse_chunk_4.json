  "content": "all of Fire, Sleet Storm, Guardian of Faith and Fireball are very handy. (You can also place explosives to make the fight easier.) Halsin will talk to you when all enemies are dead or the timer for him to return elapses. He then returns to camp with Thaniel. Talk with Halsin at camp. He will task you to look for Oliver (the strange boy you met in House in Deep Shadows). He can be found directly east of the Shadowed Battlefield waypoint. From this point on, you can have Halsin follow you like any",
