  "content": " use lockpick to open the final gate. Alternatively, you can use Dimension Door to bypass this trial. Self-Same Trial: This trial forces you to fight a clone of your parties. To make the battle a lot easier, get naked before you offer blood to the ritual bowl, and reequip your team before the battle starts. The clone team has the ability to dip in and out of the shadows. Each time a party member hits a clone that is not their own, that member will suffer a debuff reducing all ability scores. Kil",
