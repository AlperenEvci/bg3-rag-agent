(In the Cutscene, Nere kills the gnome girl Meerna. There's no way to save her, even if you engage Nere before he blast her into the lava, she will have no interaction and considered dead by other NPCs.)\n\nNote that if you take too long to free True Soul Nere, the Duergar will eventually manage to clear the rubble",
