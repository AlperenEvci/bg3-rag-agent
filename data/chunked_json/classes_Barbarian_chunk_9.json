  "content": " modifier when not wearing armor. If you're playing an unarmored Barbarian, focus on boosting both Constitution and Dexterity stats to enhance your Armor Class. Using a two-handed weapon is generally more advantageous for Barbarians, providing greater damage potential. Consider picking up the Great Weapon Master feat at level 4 for added damage and a bonus action on kills or critical hits. Use Reckless Attack to gain an advantage on attacks, but be aware that enemies also gain an advantage again",
