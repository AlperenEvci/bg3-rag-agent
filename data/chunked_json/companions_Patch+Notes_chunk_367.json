  "content": "magma mephits in Grymforge. Someone pulled the ol' switcheroo on the Eldritch Knight and Battle Master subclass icons. We've switchereed them back. Revamped the location label on the minimap to make it easier to know where you are. Updated the font in the game launcher. Fixed a bug where examining a character and then examining an item would merge both character and item into a monstrous model in a single Examine window. The character would also be T-posing and naked. Re-enabled the context menu",
