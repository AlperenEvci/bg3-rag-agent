Go inside and interact with the Sacrificial Bowl, Shadowheart will then interrupt and say this is one of Lady Shar's trials. You can then let her do as she wishes or tell her to stand down. If you choose to let her do as she pleases, you will gain her approval. She then wounds herself and offers her blood on the bowl, the gates will then open after. Now you need to skulk to the end of the maze without being spotted by the shadows",
