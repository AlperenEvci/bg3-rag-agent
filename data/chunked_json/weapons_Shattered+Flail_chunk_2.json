  "content": "\nShattered Flail is one of the Simple Melee Weapons in Baldur's Gate 3. In BG3, each type of weapon has different ranges, damages, and other features (Finesse, Versatile, Dippable, etc). Characters need to master certain Proficiency before using a weapon, and sometimes gain special Actions while holding it.\n\nA bundle of bones and blood - and a soul-piercing demonic presence - is all that remains of the Flind's flail. Your reckon it would make a decent club with a particularly nasty bite.\n\nShatte",
