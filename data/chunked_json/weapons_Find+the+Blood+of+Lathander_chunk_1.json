  "content": "ctives\n\nExplore Rosymorn Monastery. We found a note from a Lathander worshipper about a precious relic called \"The Blood\" hidden somewhere in Rosymorn Monastery. Perhaps we can find more in our exploration. Find the true Blood of Lathander. A fake artefact in Rosymorn Monastery was disguised as the Blood of Lathander - we should keep looking for the true relic. Explore the Secret Chamber. We moved some ancient Lathanderian statues and a secret passageway opened - we should see what lies within. ",
