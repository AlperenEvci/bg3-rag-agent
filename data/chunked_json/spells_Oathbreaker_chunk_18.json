You can reclaim your previous Oath at any time. Talk to the Oathbreaker Knight at the camp and tell him you want to restore your oath. He will ask you to pay 1,000 gold in order to restore it. Paladins benefit from Divine Smite for increased damage output. Be sure to setup your Reactions so that you can just melee attack, and use Divine Smite",
