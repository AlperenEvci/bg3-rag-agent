  "content": "l-stocked, the action economy of Mage Hand is a very good tradeoff compared to other healing or support spells. Being able to get this from multiple races and feats makes it possible for almost any build to assist with party support. Mage Hand is also available on all arcane spellcasters' spell lists, which in most cases makes it the sole \"healing\" spell in their repertoire.\n\nCantrips Acid Splash ♦ Blade Ward ♦ Bone Chill ♦ Dancing Lights ♦ Eldritch Blast ♦ Fire Bolt ♦ Friends ♦ Githyanki Psioni",
