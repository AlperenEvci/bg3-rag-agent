  "content": "Shortbows in Baldur's Gate 3 are pieces of equipment that are used to inflict damage against hostile characters such as Enemies and Bosses. Shortbows are Two-Handed Martial Ranged Weapons in BG3 that can only be two-handed, dealing 1-6 Damage without enchantments, the exception being the Makeshift Bow that deals 1-4 damage instead. They have a range of 15m, and they deal Piercing Damage. Being a Ranged Weapon, note that you have disadvantage on attack rolls with Shortbows while Threatened.\n\nMany",
