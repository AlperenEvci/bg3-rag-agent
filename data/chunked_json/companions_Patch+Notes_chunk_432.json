  "content": " chain of events. Polished the dialogue with the owlbear cub, improving where characters are looking and standing. Fixed Mizora's wings popping when she arrives at camp. Fixed a pop in the confrontation between Aradin and Zevlor at the Emerald Grove. Fixed Pooldripp's thumb clipping with his mouth. You can now see Pooldripp when BOOOAL tells you he's a god. Fixed a line getting cut short in the dialogue with Sovereign Glut. Updated the camera shots for different character heights in the dialogue",
