  "content": "where the game's script was not intentionally pausing them. Reduced the duration of the Shar's Darkness spell and the frequency with which NPCs choose to cast it. Swapping weapons between characters in combat now properly consumes an Action for both. Fixed the Meenlock Fear condition triggering a Constitution Saving Throw instead of a Wisdom Saving Throw. Fixed Auntie Ethel's Weird Magic Surge not triggering with Counterspell. Combat will now end correctly if you find that you're still in combat",
