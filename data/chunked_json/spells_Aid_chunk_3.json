Therefore, you can easily cast this spell on any party members you plan to use while leaving the caster back in camp. If the caster of this spell removes it from their prepared spells list, the spell's effect will end immediately. In D&D5e Aid is limited to 3 targets, in BG3 there's no such numerical limitation, so any pet or summon will also benefit.\n\nLvl 2 S",
