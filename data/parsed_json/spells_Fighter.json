The Fighter is one of the classes that retained its base features. The Know Your Enemy feature is originally from DnD 5E, however, this will not be applied in Baldur's Gate 3. Fighters gain Action Surge at level 2, allowing them to take an extra action. Remember to short rest often to regain this ability, and consider using it for crucial attacks. An efficient use of Action Surge is to use it on a turn where all of the Fighter's attacks will receive some form of bonus, maximizing the gains in damage granted from an additional action. An example of such a bonus can be when an ally has an enemy affected by Hold Person or Hold Monster, rendering all hits from 3 meters away critical hits automatically. Choosing the Dueling fighting style complements a one-handed weapon and shield, providing bonus damage and allowing you to tank effectively. When choosing a Subclass: Battle Master offers dynamic combat options with maneuvers, making it a great choice for beginners who want more strategic choices in battles. Battle Master can particularly reward effective synergy between the Fighter and other party members through maneuvers that allow allies reposition themselves, focus enemy aggression onto the Fighter and off of potentially frailer allies, grant allies temporary Hit Points, and more. Eldritch Knight in Baldur's Gate 3 is the only way to acquire spellcasting as a Fighter without Multiclassing. These spells can be used to damage and debuff enemies, buff companions, or create other effects, which can be combined tactically with the martial prowess of the Fighter class to offer a variety of approaches to combat encounters. Champion focuses on straightforward bonuses such as reducing the threshold needed to score a Critical Hit on an attack, improving the Fighter's proficiencies in physical checks, and allowing the Fighter to chose a second fighting style. A Fighter build with Lae'zel was shared in one of the comments below: With the Fighter Class, choose the Dual Wielding Specialisation and the Dual Wield Feat. Choose the Battle Master as the Subclass and choose Riposte and any of the Manoeuvres you prefer. With the forge, you can create Heavy Armor, and equip both Heavy Armor and the Grymskull Helm you get from the golem at the Adamantine Forge.\n\nAn efficient use of Action Surge is to use it on a turn where all of the Fighter's attacks will receive some form of bonus, maximizing the gains in damage granted from an additional action.
