Save the Refugees can be acquired during Chapter One of the first Act. Completing Save the Refugees will progress the story forward.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Save the Refugees Objectives\n\nHelp the Emerald Grove.\n\nRath believes that Halsin is the only one able to persuade Kagha to stop the ritual - and save the tieflings.\n\nSpeak with Kagha.\n\nKagha, leader of the Druids, ordered the tieflings to leavethe grove. Zevlor fears they won;t survive the road and asked us to intervene.\n\nReturn to Zevlor.\n\nKagha wants us to make the Tieflings leave - she fears the grove cannot support both of them and itself. We found a note involving Kagha. Something is going on in the grove. We should get to the bottom of it.\n\nEnd the conflict.\n\nKagha plans to seal the grove shut, while Zevlor won't leave until the roads are safe. We need to resolve this\n\nHelp the tieflings leave.\n\nThe tieflings are safe - for now. But they still need to reach Baldur's Gate. That can't happen until the roads are safe from goblins.\n\nHow to unlock Save the Refugees\n\nSave the Refugees Rewards\n\nSave the Refugees Walkthrough\n\nThere are multiple ways to complete this quest:\n\nAfter speaking with Kagha, speak with Zevlor and take on the task to kill Kagha. Go back and kill Kagha and a few druids. Rath and his wolf stay out of the fight. This fight is played out outside of the grove too, where the druids attack the Tiefling refugees, but are ultimately defeated.\n\nFind out Kagha's secret\n\nAfter speaking with Kagha, open her chest (somewhat hidden at the back of one of the rooms) - it's a white chest, so you don't have to worry about stealing from it.\n\nYou'll find a letter to Kagha, which adds a marker to your map, in the south-east corner of the Sunlit Wetlands/Putrid Bog (south-east of the Teahouse) in the Decrepit Sanctum. If you follow this pointer to (X:98, Y:237), you have a rather strong fight on your hands at the marked location. You'll find a group of level 4 Wood Woads and Ancient Mud Mephits. Next to the large tree base in the middle of this island, you'll find a Wooden Chest. To the left of the chest, walk through the Twisting Vines and approach the chopped down tree. Your character will automatically roll a Perception Check. If you succeed, you'll find a Wooden Crevice that contains the Letter to Kagha, revealing that Kagha wishes to hand over the Emerald Grove to the Shadow Druids.\n\nAfter reading the message, return to the Emerald Grove and confront Khaga in her room past the Stone Door. Reveal to her that you know about her plan. A short cutscene will play, revealing that the 3 mice in her room were actually polymorphed Shadow Druids. When Rath asks what's going on, give him the letter you found in the Decrepit Sanctuary. An arguement will ensue and your next set of choices when speaking to Kahga will look like this:\n\n[PERSUASION] The shadows won't save you - they'll corrupt you. Stop this, while you can. [DETECT THOUGHTS] Probe Kagha's mind. Take the grove - I won't stand in your way. You seem intent on forcing me to take your life. So be it.\n\nIf you try detecting her thoughts and fail, she will attack. If you succeed, you get the option to persuade her without rolling for persuation.If you choose the first option, you'll have to pass a DC 15 Persuasion Check. Succeed and your character will automatically roll an Insight Check. If you pass, you'll notice that your words seem to have reached Kagha, but she's still hesitating. You will then have to choose from another set of choices:\n\n[WOOD ELF] Recite the frescoes you have read. Remind Kagha of the grove's legacy. [RELIGION] I know these druids' ways. All they touch is fated to decay. [PERSUASION]You know I'm right. Don't let the shadows corrupt you. I tried reasoning with you. Looks like it'll take blood to settle this.\n\nThe first choice is avaliable if you're read the stone slates around the room. If you choose the third choice, the DC you'll have to beat is 10. If you succeed, Astarion will disapprove while Gale and Karlach will approve. Kagha will see reason and help you defeat the Shadow Druids.\n\nA fight against the Shadow Druids will begin after the conversation is done. You will get help from Rath, his wolf and a few other druids, as well as Kagha if you managed to persuade her. Defeat them, then you can speak to Rath and Kagha for some extra dialogue about what happens next.\n\nReturn to Zevlor in the Secluded Chamber and tell him that Kagha's agreed to stop the ritual. He's grateful, but he asks for one more thing - to ensure that the roads are clear of the goblin threat to allow his people save passage to Baldur's Gate. If you simply agree without asking for compensation, Astarion will disapprove. The next thing to do is to travel to the Goblin Camp and clear them out.\n\nClear out the Goblin Camp\n\nKagha, the leader of the Druids decide to close the grove and expel all the Tiefling refugees. If you saved the Goblin Sazza at makeshift prison (Quest Save the Goblin Sazza). The priestess wants you to help her open the gate of Druid Grove and slaughter all the refugees. The Goblin camp lies to the northwest of Blighted Village. To infiltrate the goblin camp, you can have goblin Sazza to vouch for you. (Quest Save the Goblin Sazza) Use the passage on the right of the front gate. (Use jump to reach there). Or, you can try to persuade the goblin garrison, by using the Deception (15)/ Nature (10) / Intimidation (15) skills and obey the goblin's commands. To enter the Shattered Sanctum peacefully, either uses the psionic power, or pass Deception (15) check. If you want to fight the goblins in camp, there is a spot that allows you to shoot them without worrying about retaliation. You can reach there through Mountain Pass. Halsin is imprisoned in Worg Pen, in the form of a bear. Defeat the goblins there to free him. To defeat the goblins, you need to kill all the goblin leaders. (Dror Ragzlin, Priestess Gut, and the drow Minthara). Or, you can side with them and help them raid the Druid Grove. When you fight the goblin leaders, try to use the high grounds to ambush them. (If you agree to let priestess Gut to heal you, she will move to an empty room alone. You can ambush her there.) To defeat the goblins at camp, you can add poison to this Booze Tub. But be careful, if you got caught, you will have to toast before them. If you decide to side with Goblins, talk to Minthara. (You can invite her to spend a night together at camp, after the quest is complete. Just like companions.) You need to reveal the location of Druid Grove to her, and open the gate for the raiders. (You can also steal the Druid artifact, so the Tieflings and Druids will fight each other. See Quest Steal the Sacred Idol) After you killed all the goblin leaders, you can leave the area through Underdark, or fast travel. You can find Absolute's Warboard (Uncommon Shield), Faithbreaker (Rare Martial hammer), Xyanyde (Rare melee weapon) on these goblin leaders. After you killed all the Goblin leaders, return to Druid and claim your reward. Ruth will give you a Rune of the Wolf. Use it to open the secret room in enclave library. Place the Wolf Rune, then activate all the runes will open the entrance to Hidden Vault. There you can find Sorrow (Rare 2-handed Melee Weapon), Robe of Summer (Rare Clothing) and Wyvern Poison (Rare potion, coat weapon). Rest at camp, join the celebration if you helped the Tieflings. You can invite a companion of yours to spend the night together. Talk to Halsin the next day to complete this quest. If you sides with the druids but still wishes to meet Minthara at the Moonrise Towers, she must be knocked out when fought. This can be done whether at her camp in the Shattered Sanctum or when defending the grove from the goblin attack. If Minthara is knocked out in the goblin camp the party must not take a Long Rest before the quest Defeat the Goblins is finished.\n\nSave the Refugees Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nQuests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
