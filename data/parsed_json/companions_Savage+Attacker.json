It will actually re-roll all of the damage dice that you do in this case, giving you the highest number of the two numbers you roll for each dice. It is a great Feat for Paladins, since it works in conjunction with Divine Smite melee attacks or any of their Smite spells giving them double rolls for every dice. Does not reroll the Rogue's Sneak Attack dice however. Savage Attacker does not work on unarmed attacks but works with Divine Smite, and Improved Divine Smite. Instead of comparing the totals for the rolls, it compares each individual die with its reroll. For example, when you attack with a greatsword dealing 2d6 damage, if the first d6 is a 1 and it's reroll is a 5, and the second d6 is a 5 and it's reroll is a 1, the total would be 10, even though the total results of both the original 2d6 and the savage attacker rerolls are 6. As an example, a Paladin dealing crit damage with a longsword and using a Level 2 Smite (total of 8d8) would go from dealing 36 + STR to 46.4 + STR - This is excellent to get if you're using Smite a lot, and want to deal more damage. This feat works better for bigger dice than for smaller ones (e.g. d12 benefits more than d6). For an n-sided dice, the expected value of the maximum value of 2 throws is (n+1)(4n-1)/(6n). Its easy enough to calculate yourself (I am not allowed to attach any links to the wiki, sorry). Divide it by an average result of 1 roll (we can look at each dice pair individually because they are independent), which is (n+1)/2, and get a factor of (4n-1)/(3n) = 4/3 - 1/(3n). For example, for d6 the boost is 1.2(7) and for d12 it is 1.30(5). The difference is small, but it is there.",
