Examples of this include betraying the Tieflings when rescuing Lae'zel, betraying the goblins within the Blighted Village as well as the Shattered Sanctum. Allowing Arka to kill the caged goblin Sazza. (As of 8/12/2023, this doesn't work to break Oath of the Ancients.) Killing the Owlbear mother, then killing the cub as well. Torture Liam at the Shattered Sanctum. Use the wand to raise Connor Vinderblad back from the dead. Refuse to let the Pixe out of the Moon Lantern. Oath of Vengeance subclass offers more versatility for making morally ambiguous decisions, while Oathbreaker allows the player to choose whatever decisions he or she wants, both good and evil. Paladins benefit from Divine Smite for increased damage output. Be sure to setup your Reactions so that you can just melee attack, and use Divine Smite if you want. To do this, hit \"L\" on the keyboard and tick each level of Divine Smite \"On\" and to \"Ask\". This will allow you to use Divine Smite with other Weapon Actions, Opportunity Attacks, as well as Smite Spells. If you are multiclassing out of Paladin, multiclassing after level 2 or 6 is ideal because at level 2 you can bring Divine Smite and all your Proficiencies to another Class, while by level 6 you would have Extra Attack and Aura of Protection, which are both fantastic. Because Heavy Armour does not scale AC to Dexterity in the same way Light and Medium Armour do, it can be viable to dump Dexterity and use Heavy Armour without worrying about taking a -1 penalty to AC at 8 DEX. However, bear in mind that your DEX will still affect Dexterity Saving Throws and Initiative rolls. Paladins in BG3 primarily use Charisma to determine the bonus granted by their Aura of Protection and the number of Spells they can Prepare at one time. Charisma also determines the DC enemies must beat to save against your spell effects, however are very few offensive Paladin Spells that require the target to make a Saving Throw. For the most part, these Saving Throws affect secondary effects (such as the Frightened condition inflicted by Wrathful Smite or Searing Smite's damage over time), and do not alter the base damage of these spells, making it less necessary to pump Charisma if your build is focusing solely on damage output. Extra Attack only provides a second Attack if you used your Action to Attack to begin with. You cannot cast a spell and then attack, or attack and then cast a spell. Additionally, Extra Attack doesn't stack with other Classes that have Extra Attack (for example, a 5/5 Fighter/Paladin would benefit from Extra Attack once, having only two attacks per turn). Using the Dueling fighting style maximizes damage while using a one-handed weapon and a shield. Dueling is particularly good if you are out of Spell Slots and cannot Divine Smite. Defense is also a great choice of Fighting Style since most Paladin damage comes from Divine Smite anyway. Remember that Dueling only works with Versatile Weapons when they are being used as one-handed weapons and not as two-handed weapons (for example, the Fighting Style would work with a versatile weapon in one hand and a shield in the other, because a shield does not count as a weapon and the versatile counts as a one-handed weapon at that point).\n\nIn general, going back on your word and betraying those you have convinced not to attack you will break your oath.
