  "content": "In Baldur's Gate 3 Each class has a \"Spellcasting Ability\". This is the ability score used to determine how effective you spells are, and affects a number of things, including your number of spells prepared (if applicable), the Saving Throw Difficulty Class (DC) of your spells, and your spell attack modifier. Some spells add numerical effects based on your spellcasting ability, like the spell healing word which heals additional hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier.\n\nSpells in Baldur's Gate 3 are regulated forms of magic energy. In BG3, there are certain Classes that can cast spells to damage Enemies, buff Companions or create other effects. Wizards and Clerics have different sets of spells, while characters of other classes may cast a spell using Scrolls. BG3 Spells Mechanics Concentration for Spells in BG3 Concentration is required to maintain certain spells. You lose Concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires Concentration. You can’t concentrate on two Spells at once. You can also willfully cancel Concentration on a Spell. For example, you no longer have to suffer the prolonged effects of Fog Cloud if you break Concentration. You can simply click on the Concentration indicator to interrupt the Spell (No action is required). Long and Partial Rest in Baldur's Gate 3 In order to take a Long Rest, you’ll have to gather camp supplies, which comprise all of the food and scrap you can buy (or steal). Heaps of food should go a long way to keep you satiated and ready for the events to come. If you’re low on supplies, you can opt to take a Partial Rest instead. This only restores a portion of your HP and Spell Slots, but it won’t use up any food. How Spells influence dice Rolls Dice rolls play an active part in whatever action you decide to do, may it be in combat or in dialogue. You can also favorable roll. To increase the chances of surpassing a check, you can manually add your or your Companions’ Spells to your throw. But remember that you may make use of Spell Slots when you cast aSpell, so choose wisely. This bonus will be added to the ones you already have (be it for any Proficiency or Abilities), and the total sum will be added to your roll. So, for example, you can cast Enhance Ability first to account for the Advantage bonus you get to roll twice. This raises the chances of tipping the scale in your favour. Alternatively, Guidance is also a good Spell, which also increases your chances for success.

In BG3, there are certain Classes that can cast spells to damage Enemies, buff Companions or create other effects. Wizards and Clerics have different sets of spells, while characters of other classes may cast a spell using Scrolls.\n\nBG3 Spells Mechanics\n\nConcentration for Spells in BG3\n\nConcentration is required to maintain certain spells. You lose Concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires Concentration. You can’t concentrate on two Spells at once. You can also willfully cancel Concentration on a Spell. For example, you no longer have to suffer the prolonged effects of Fog Cloud if you break Concentration. You can simply click on the Concentration indicator to interrupt the Spell (No action is required).\n\nLong and Partial Rest in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nIn order to take a Long Rest, you’ll have to gather camp supplies, which comprise all of the food and scrap you can buy (or steal). Heaps of food should go a long way to keep you satiated and ready for the events to come. If you’re low on supplies, you can opt to take a Partial Rest instead. This only restores a portion of your HP and Spell Slots, but it won’t use up any food.\n\nHow Spells influence dice Rolls\n\nDice rolls play an active part in whatever action you decide to do, may it be in combat or in dialogue. You can also favorable roll. To increase the chances of surpassing a check, you can manually add your or your Companions’ Spells to your throw. But remember that you may make use of Spell Slots when you cast aSpell, so choose wisely. This bonus will be added to the ones you already have (be it for any Proficiency or Abilities), and the total sum will be added to your roll.\n\nSo, for example, you can cast Enhance Ability first to account for the Advantage bonus you get to roll twice. This raises the chances of tipping the scale in your favour. Alternatively, Guidance is also a good Spell, which also increases your chances for success.\n\nCantrip Lvl 1 Spells Lvl 2 Spells Lvl 3 Spells Lvl 4 Spells Lvl 5 Spells Lvl 6 Spells\n\nWizard Spells Sorcerer Spells Warlock Spells Bard Spells Druid Spells Cleric Spells Paladin Spells Ranger Spells Rogue Spells Fighter Spells\n\nAbjuration Spells Conjuration Spells Divination Spells Enchantment Spells Evocation Spells Illusion Spells Necromancy Spells Transmutation Spells\n\nAll Spells in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nYou can search by Name, Level, School, Casting Time and Class.
