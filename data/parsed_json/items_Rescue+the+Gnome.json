  "content": "Rescue the gnome Type Quest Chapter Chapter One Location Blighted Village Reward None\n\nRescue the gnome\n\nRescue the Gnome is a Quest in Baldur's Gate 3. Rescue the gnome can be acquired during Chapter One of the first Act. Completing Rescue the gnome will progress the story forward.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Rescue the Gnome Objectives\n\nApproach the Goblins\n\nWe spotted a deep gnome tied to the blades of a windmill. He's being tormented by a group of goblins.\n\nStop the windmill.\n\nThe goblins attacked us. We've defeated the goblins. If we want to help the gnome, we'll have to stop the windmill. Now that that the windmill has stopped spinning, we should be able to untie the gnome.\n\nIt took some convincing, but the goblins left. If we want to help the gnome, we'll have to stop the windmill. (if the goblins were persuaded to leave instead)\n\nQuest Completed!\n\nAfter rescuing Barcus Wroot, we parted ways with him.\n\nHow to unlock Rescue the gnome\n\nBlighted Village\n\nRescue the gnome Rewards\n\nRescue the Gnome Walkthrough\n\nFrom the Blighted Village Waypoint, keep heading northwest until you encounter some goblins by a windmill. When you approach them the Quest Rescue the Gnome begins and you'll be thrust into a cutscene. You can immediately start a fight with the goblins if you want to save the gnome quickly. If you want to save the gnome peacefully, you can ask the goblins what they're doing with the gnome. Afterwards, demand they release the gnome and you'll be met with four options:\n\n[INTIMIDATION] I won't let you harm a defenceless being - not without a fight. [PERSUASION] All of you lot against one deep gnome? You should find a better target. [DETECT THOUGHTS] Read the goblin's mind. [ILLITHID] [WISDOM] You will release the gnome. That's an order.\n\nIf you choose the second option, you'll have to pass a DC 15 Persuasion Check. Succeed, and the goblins will leave with Shadowheart's, Karlach's and Gale's approval. The Gnome is still stuck to the windmill, so you'll have to find a way to get him down. Head around to the back of the windmill and enter through the hole in the wall. There are two levers here - the 'Release Brake' Lever and the 'Brake' Lever. Hit the Brake Lever to stop the windmill from spinning. If you stop it too quickly after the goblins leave, they'll notice the windmill stop spinning, so give it a bit of time before you hit the lever. Alternatively, if you press the 'Release Brake' Lever, the gnome will be lost.\n\nHead back out to the windmill fan to let the gnome down. He's irritable, but you'll learn his name is Barcus Wroot. If you ask him what happened he'll show you an amulet and be on his way. Since you saved Barcus, you will later meet him again at the Grymforge, in the quest Save the Grymforge Gnomes.\n\nRescue the Gnome Notes & Tips\n\nNote: You can cast Feather Fall on him, but unfortunately it won't have an effect if you choose to release brakes. There's explosive in gnome's backpack, you can use it in combat, or keep it for Find the Explosives.\n\nQuests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
