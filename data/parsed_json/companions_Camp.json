  "content": "The Camp is a special feature of Baldur's Gate 3 (BG 3). The Camp also serves as a temporary shelter for you and your Companions. You can also invite other NPCs to stay at a camp and there are some quests that can only be advanced once you've rested at a Camp. When your characters use their spells slots, they need to rest at camp to refresh them. You can also interact with your companions at the Camp and do actions such as discussing the Quests or advancing Romances. You can fast travel to the campsite anytime outside battles, arriving campsite this way triggers the day-time version of the location.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Camp Guide\n\nAs mentioned above, a Camp is your temporary shelter where you and your Companions can rest. You can also invite other NPCs to stay at a camp, and certain quests can only progress after you've rested at a camp. Resting at a camp is essential for refreshing your character's spell slots. You can interact with your Companions within a camp, engage in discussions about Quests, and have deeper interactions with certain companions to further romantic relationships.\n\nInteract with your Companions\n\nBesides resting at a Camp, you will have the opportunity to interact with your Companions on a more personal level. Engage in conversations and get to know them better. You will also see an exclamation mark above your companion's head that may indicate a new important conversation. You can also receive unique companion quests that can be advanced or resolved within a Camp. Take your time in getting to know your companions and learn more about them, this can strengthen your bond with them.\n\nManage your Party\n\nThe Camp is the best place to strategize and recuperate from your last combat engagement. It is also the best place to make important decisions about your next course of action. Try to discuss quest options and choose your dialogue options wisely as this can significantly impact the story. You will have the option to change the current members of your active party. To make a Companion stay within a Camp, simply initiate a conversation with them and ask them to stay there, and they will leave the party. Conversely, you can also ask a companion to join you. Do note that asking a companion to join you will end in a positive response only if your active team doesn't consist of 4 people already.\n\nRomancing Companions in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nThe Camp is the best location to strengthen your bond and grow your relationships with your Companions. While you're at the Camp(while you are resting), you can engage in deeper interactions and conversations with them. As your companions' confidence in you grows, you will have the chance to initiate romantic dialogues, commencing a potential romance. Successfully initiating a romantic relationship with a Companion will unlock new dialogue options that can potentially lead to deeper intimacy. Many romance events can only trigger during long rest, if you take too few long rests, some events may get skipped. You can visit the Romance Guide page to learn more about the different romanceable characters and how you can romance them in Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nHow do I set up a Camp in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nTo set up camp, you need to select the Long Rest option located within the campfire icon on the right side of the UI. You would also need 40 Camp Supplies in order to take a Long Rest and this will fully restore your Hit Points and Spell Slots. A Short Rest will not require you to spend any Camp Supplies but it will only restore your Hit Points and Spell Slots to a certain degree.\n\nIt is important to take note that if you select Long Rest, the game will advance into the next day, this will restore your Character and Companions' HP and remove any negative status effects applied to any of them. You need to be careful not to have any time-sensitive quests active when you choose the Long Rest option as it will automatically fail.\n\nIn Baldur's Gate, you can rent a place at Elfsong Tavern to serve as your camp.\n\nInventory Management\n\nWithin the Camp, there is what's called a Storage Box. You can put all unwanted items within the box without fear that they will be lost from your inventory. Your party can easily be overloaded with items and the Storage Box is a great way to deal with the inventory limit. It is recommended that you put unnecessary heavy objects within the storage box, this includes some weapons and armor that you don't currently need at the moment.\n\nEquip and manage your gear and manage your items efficiently. Properly equipping your character and companions will greatly enhance your party's combat capabilities and overall effectiveness.\n\nYou can place items and containers in a camp, but if you move to another camp, these items will not be moved to new camp.\n\nUnique NPC appearances within the Camp\n\nThere are certain NPCs that you will meet as you progress through the game that may appear in the camp. This will usually occur if you've met a certain NPC and invited them to your Camp. For example, you will find Withers (The Hooded Skeleton) during the quest Explore the Ruins. This NPC is impossible to miss and will eventually show up in your camp. Withers can then offer his services of resurrecting a fallen companion for 200 Gold.\n\nTaking a Rest in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nResting in Baldur's Gate 3, whether or not it be at Camp, will be your main means of replenishing depleted resources. There are three types of rests, each with varying lengths, requirements, and benefits.\n\nA Short Rest is, as its name implies, a period in which your party takes a quick break from adventuring. Taking a short rest will advance the in-game time by 15 minutes and does not have any supply requirements. Short Rests are great for recovering certain resources, particularly Hit Points (HP), without needing to retreat from the area, and you can take one at anytime while out of combat by clicking on the closed eye icon in the top right of your screen, by the map. In D&D, you would be able to recover Health by spending a number of Hit Dice determined by your class. However, in Baldur's Gate 3, you will heal half your maximum Hit Points during a Short Rest instead.\n\nBesides HP, some Classes will regain charges of their special class Actions/Features on a Short Rest. Warlocks, for instance, are the only spell casters that can fully replenish their used Spell Slots on a Short Rest. Other notable Features that replenish on a short rest are Paladin's and Cleric's abilities to summon the holy power of their Oath/Deities through Channel Oath and Channel Divinity respectively, and the Fighter's ability to regain Actions through Action Surge. Weapon-specific Actions, such as Backbreaker for Warhammers, are also replenished on a short rest. If you are unsure about which Actions come back on a Short rest, be sure to check it's description or hover over it's icon on your HUD.\n\nYou only have two 'charges' of Short Rests, after which you will have to take a Long Rest to regain both charges, or have a Bard perform the Song of Rest to replenish one charge.\n\nBefore taking a Long Rest, you must fast travel back to Camp by clicking on the campfire icon on the top right of your screen. You can fast travel at any time and place, so long as you are out of combat and there are no visible threats in the vicinity. When in Camp, interact with a Bedroll to open up a menu and choose to spend 40 Supplies to take a Long Rest. This will fast forward the game to the next day, so make sure you're keeping track of any time-sensitive quests that are currently active. Each Food & Drink, as well as Supply Pack, provides the party with a varying number of Camp Supplies.\n\nTaking a Long Rest will fully restore the party's Hit Points (HP) and Spell Slots, as well as any Actions, Spells or Features that have charges or 'cooldowns', and Items with special uses. This is also the prime time to advance your Companion Quests and view unique cutscenes with them. Do note that in Early Access, you can only encounter one cutscene/bonding moment with each Companion per Long Rest, even if you took steps to be eligible for more. To view more Camp cutscenes with your Companions, you will have to take more Long Rests.\n\nIf you are low on Camp Supplies and have no means to get some more, or if you don't have any need for the full effect of a Long Rest, when interacting with a Bedroll, you can choose to take a Partial Long Rest instead. You do not need to spend any Camp Supplies for a Partial Rest, but all party members will only recover half their maximum Hit Points (like during a Short Rest), and half of their maximum Spell Slots. Time will pass as if you've taken a Long Rest, but any missing Short Rest charges will not be replenished. This is a decent option to take if you're not hurting for more HP or Spell Slots, but still want to return to camp to rest and interact with your Companions.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Camp Information\n\nCan be invited to camp\n\nWithers (The hooded skeleton) you find in quest Explore the Ruins will appear in camp and provide revival services.
