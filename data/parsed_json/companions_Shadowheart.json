Shadowheart will first be encountered inside the Nautiloid in Act I and can be recruited from there. She can also be found by the crypt door on the beach after the Nautiloid crashes. Shadowheart is a High Half-Elf and a Trickery Domain Cleric, a class that can heal the party, and cast stealth and deception spells. Companions assist the player once they are in the party, and each companion has a unique backstory and traits. They have their own Classes and starting equipment, with Classes being able to change via Respeccing in the camp. Some Companions can be selected as an Origin during Character Creation, allowing players to play from their point of view.\n\nA loyal servant of the goddess Shar, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken at the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate, while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within.\n\nOne of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover.\n\nWhere to find Shadowheart in BG3\n\nShadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby. Certain classes may have the option to bypass the need for the rune. She will then offer to accompany you to the helm. Once you exit the Nautiloid, you will find her unconscious on the Ravaged Beach nearby. She will thank you for freeing her earlier, and offer to join your party.\n\nHowever, if you visit the camp, trigger a fight, or find a waypoint before waking her, she will move on to the Druid Grove. She can be found sitting on a stone next to the Strange Ox.\n\nIf Shadowheart is not freed from her pod on the Nautiloid, then she can be found at the entrance of the Dank Crypt (Abandoned Ruins) at the northern end of the Ravaged Beach, where she will offer to join your party.\n\nIf Shadowheart is not interacted with at the Ravaged Beach, she will move to the Druid Grove on her own in search of a healer. She can be spoken with there and invited to join the party.\n\nIf the party enters the Goblin Camp/Mountain Pass/Underdark without having recruited Shadowheart, she will show up and save the party from the Voice of the Absolute using the Mysterious Artefact.\n\nShadowheart's BG3 Special Features\n\nFear of Wolves: whenever a wolf approaches shadowheart, she must make a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened (Cannot move. Frightened entities also have Disadvantage on Ability checks and Attack rolls.) Shar's patronage grants Shadowheart resistance to mild exposure to the Shadow Curse in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, though she will still need protection in areas where the curse is strongest. Persuading Shadowheart to consume the Noblestalk in Act 1 will trigger the sub-quest A Familiar Face. Shadowheart can interact with Mirror of Loss to gain some benefits.\n\nShadowheart's BG3 Starting Skill Proficiencies\n\nHistory Religion Insight Medicine\n\nShadowheart's BG3 Starting Equipment\n\nCirclet Chain Shirt Leather Boots Mace Studded Shield Shadowheart's Clothes (cosmetic) Tasteful Boots (cosmetic) Shadowheart's Underwear (cosmetic)\n\nBG3 Shadowheart Video Guide\n\nBG3 Shadowheart Quest Walkthrough\n\nTo complete Shadowheart's Questline, you must first meet her, either in the Nautiloid or the Ravaged Beach. If you do not recruit her on the Ravaged Beach (whether you freed her or not), she will be found in the Druid's Grove, where she will be sitting on a rock near the training area in the Hollow. She will offer again to join your party, but if Lae'zel is present, convincing her will require a successful Persuasion check. This will begin the quest:\n\nDaughter of Darkness Note: After you've acquired the Speak with Dead spell, you can go return to the Ravaged Beach and talk to the dead fishermen to learn more about Shadowheart.\n\nWARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\n\nHow to increase Approval for Shadowheart in BG3\n\nShadowheart likes a reasonable or rational approach to problems, and she appreciates being private and respecting her privacy. Shadowheart is fond of animals, and showing appreciation towards animals will increase her approval, and being cruel to animals will decrease it. Shadowheart also appreciates actions that would benefit others. As a Sharran, Shadowheart approves of actions that are against Selune and the Church of Selune.\n\nShadowheart will disapprove of any actions that go against the goddess Shar, or anything that involves unnecessary violence or cruelty. She also disapproves of the player being open with unknown individuals.\n\nHow to Romance Shadowheart in BG3\n\nIn this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force.\n\nAdditionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.\n\nAs with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.\n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I\n\nYour relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.\n\nYou're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.\n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II\n\nAct II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.\n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III\n\nAs mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.\n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide\n\nIf you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nGeneral Personality Tips\n\nReally enjoys privacy and boundaries but rewards curiosity. She appreciates when space is given to her and when people don't pry too much. Has a heart of gold under the tough exterior, and values peaceful resolutions rather than brute force. She'll appreciate using deception, wit, and persuasion to arrive at these resolutions. Hates acts of unnecessary cruelty. Approves of deeds of self-Interests including extortion, thievery, and scamming, as long as they're justified enough. This makes her approval instances somewhat have an inconsistent pattern. A lot of her approval instances come from Persuasion, Deception, Religion, and Insight Checks. Her most important scenes require successful Insight checks. Failing some will actually earn disapproval from her. Dislikes Lae'zel and most of her opinions and ideas. As a worshipper of Shar and also by default a Cleric of the Trickery Domain. Following her principles of secrecy, indirect approach, and deceit as a consistent principle is a good way of gaining approval with Shadowheart.\n\nCheck out our Companion Guide for all compiled approval instances\n\nNote this guide is a work in progress. Some of the information below reflects what was available during Early Access. Some situations, flags, and events may have changed.

Your party will continue the investigation regarding this power and will lead you to travel to Gauntlet of Shar. At the Verge of the Shadows at (X:-718 Y:-845) you will find a body of water that serves as the entrance to Shadowfell, the domain of Lady Shar. You will get a warning that the state of the region can change depending on your decisions, such as quests becoming unavailable. If you proceed to do so, we recommend following our guide to get the desired outcome. In this case, we will allow Shadowheart to save the Nightsong but betray Lady Shar.\n\nAs you step forward into the statue and through the body of water, you will feel your body struggle as you fight back the sensation. Your character will get knocked out, together with your party. Once you come back to your senses, you will find yourselves in Shadowfell, and Shadowheart immediately recognizes the presence of Lady Shar. However, you will be interrupted as Balthazar flies in to tell you to hurry along and become a witness to his work. Shadowheart defies him and quickly tells him that he does not belong in the Dark Lady's domain.\n\nIn this area, Balthazar has no desire to fight unless you initiate it. He will ask that you follow him as he leads the way into Nightsong's Prison. Your party will be doing a series of jumps until you make it to the bottom of Shadowfell. The pattern shouldn't be difficult and each member is guaranteed to survive the jumps as long as it's near the ledge, and not falling off the rocks. Once you finally catch up with Balthazar, you realize that the relic that Discipe Z'rell was referring to was the Nightsong, which is in fact, a humanoid. She invites you to \"heap more sins upon your head. My retribution will be all the sweeter for them.\" Nightsong continues to reveal, that she supplies Ketheric Thorm's immortality with her own soul. Balthazar calls her \"Aylin\" and commands you to keep back to secure her for a journey.\n\nBalthazar will tell you that she, the Nightsong, possesses immortal strength and lends it to General Throm through his work. After realizing that she is the key to Ketheric Thorm's immortality, you will now have the option to save her or let Balthazar do his job.\n\nIf she's the reason Ketheric Thorm is invulnerable, you're not taking her. Leave, or you're a dead man. Go on, then. Take the Nightsong to Ketheric. Get it over with. Attack him.\n\nIf you choose the first option, Karlach will give you her approval and you will begin to fight Balthazar right after. Take note that this area is surrounded by Balthazar's minions and they will have the advantage as they are in a higher position. Plan well so you can survive this assault. With Balthazar out of the picture, the Nightsong addresses Shadowheart. She possesses the power to free her or kill her. Shadowheart will turn to you and tells you that \"Her fate is mine to seal. Let me handle this.\" but the Nightsong tells her that the only fate she's sealing is her own and that to become a Dark Justiciar, she will know no love, no joy, but only servitude.\n\nShadowheart is conflicted about what she wants to achieve and you will be given the option to help her out:\n\nTrust Shadowheart- do not interfere. Do as you must. Is this truly what you want? Choose your own way, Shadoeheart. You cannot allow your goddess to control you. Please, Shadowheart. Don't do this.\n\nIf you choose the 3rd option, you will sense hesitance in her voice. You will get another chance to talk to her, or sway her with the next choices:\n\nTrust Shadowheart- do not interfere. Do as you must. Choose your own way, Shadoeheart. You cannot allow your goddess to control you. Please, Shadowheart. Don't do this.\n\nChoose the 4th option which will then lead you to the next choices:\n\nAll right. You have my support. This is wrong... but I can't afford to lose you. Do what you must. You want to fight? Fine.\n\nNext, choose the 2nd option so Nightsong will once again, interrupt your conversation with Shadowheart. Nightsong reveals that she knows of the only memory that Shadowheart has. The memory of her being hunted by wolves, and yet, Shadowheart still can't remember what she has lost. Shadowheart still believes that she is meant to become the Lady Justiciar, and you will get the next choices here:\n\nKill her. Let's finish this ritual. [PERSUASION] Don't do it, Shadowheart. Don't kill her, you'll regret it. She knows something about you. Spare her, and see what she has to say. Say nothing.\n\nIf you attempt the Persuasion check, you will need to pass a DC of 21, choosing the 3rd option will also get the same results and grant the approval of Karlach. When successful, she will procure the spear of Lady Shar and grips it tightly as if she's ready for anything that was to come, and yet, she throws away the spear, abandoning her lifelong quest. Shadowheart now fears that she will be disowned, and she fears what will happen next to her. Nightsong tells her that her fate is not fixed and to lay a friendly hand on her, to fight the battle that has been awaiting her, the one that will take your party to Ketheric Thorm, back to Moonrise Towers.\n\nUpon doing so, she calls out to Moonmaiden Selune as power surges through her arm. She declares that the Nightsong is no more, and she transforms into an armored Dame Aylin. She spreads out her wings and swings her mighty sword. She addresses Shadowheart once again and urges that she was able to spurn her Dark Lady, and may start to feel a stirring of the truth after what she has done. Dame Aylin that there is a battle yet to be fought after being freed from her century-long prison. She will now ask Shadowheart, \"Are you ready?\"\n\nReady for what? Dark Lady be merciful... What have I done? To get out of this place? Absolutely. For my weapon? Naturally.\n\nIf you choose the first one, she responds with \"To kill Ketheric Thorm\" and she will fly away to lead the assault in Moonrise Towers against Thorm's army. Shadowheart asks that you leave Shadowfell already after what she has done, and she doesn't want to be in her domain when her rage falls upon her. As you travel through the portal, Shadowheart goes out for a moment. She tells you that she heard Lady Shar's voice after she defied her. She has been abandoned by her goddess and allies. Powerless, she will now seek answers from Dame Aylin.\n\nShadowheart will earn the following rewards:\n\nMoonbeam Selune's Spear of Night Moonlight Glaive\n\nRESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SAVING THE NIGHTSONG\n\nIf you remain supportive of Shadowheart and continue becoming her lover, there is a good chance that you will advance your romance with her. Make sure to check the Companion Approvals page to get her approvals. Aside from that, Saving the Nightsong will also result to an easier battle against Ketheric Thorm, but the fight will be taken beneath the Moonrise Towers, to the Mind Flayer Colony. This is where the second and final battle against Ketheric Thorm will take place.\n\nSHADOWHEART KILLS THE NIGHTSONG AND BECOMES THE DARK JUSTICIAR\n\nENDING REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS:\n\nKill Balthazar Kill Nightsong\n\nHOW TO OBTAIN ENDING:\n\nChoose the following dialogue options indicated below to lead Shadowheart into following Lady Shar\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nWhen Shadowheart confronts the Nightsong, she tells Shadowheart that the only fate she's sealing is her own, that she will know no love, no joy, but only servitude. At this point, you sense Shadowheart's hesitation, and you may be able to sway her from the path of duty to the path of light. If you want the outcome of Shadowheart becoming Lady Justiciar, choose the second one.\n\nTrust Shadowheart- do not interfere. Do as you must. Is this truly what you want? Choose your own way, Shadoeheart. You cannot allow your goddess to control you. Please, Shadowheart. Don't do this.\n\nThen your next choice should be the first one. However, if you choose the first one, Karlach will give you her disapproval, while Astarion will give his approval.\n\nKill her. Let's finish this ritual. [PERSUASION] Don't do it, Shadowheart. Don't kill her, you'll regret it. She knows something about you. Spare her, and see what she has to say. Say nothing.\n\nShadowheart summons the Spear of Lady Shar and pierces Nightsong with it. Nightsong tells her that she is Shar's child after all as she feels true death, at last. Shortly after, Shadowheart will hear the voice of her goddess, Lady Shar. She calls out to her as her Chosen, her Warrior, and her Dark Justiciar. After this, Shadowheart will receive rewards from her. Lady Shar speaks of attacking Ketheric Thorm after he shunned her embrace and using her domain to house the Nightsong. If you follow this guide, killing Nightsong will complete the 'Find the Nightsong' quest.\n\nShadowheart will receive the following rewards:\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets Dark Justiciar Half-Plate Dark Justiciar Mail Dark Justiciar Boots Shar's Spear of Evening\n\nRESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF KILLING THE NIGHTSONG\n\nAs Shadowheart embraces the will of Lady Shar and she becomes Shar's chosen, she will tell you that there will be no room for love now that she has become the Dark Justiciar. This will throw out any chances of romancing Shadowheart. Additionally, the following events will take place:\n\nThe Selunite Cleric named Isobel will perish during the battle, and the Last Light Inn will get attacked Jaheira will die in battle Dammon will die, preventing the player from earning Infernal Iron that can be used in Karlach's romance and personal quest Art Cullagh will also die, preventing you to recruit Halsin and the famed bear form romance.\n\nShadowheart Tips and Notes\n\nVoiced by Jennifer English\n\nIntelligent Cleric of Shar/Loviatar/Selune Build\n\nThis build centers on healing synergies and buffs for the party while rounding out Shadowheart's laughable intelligence.
