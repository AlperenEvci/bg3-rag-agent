Extinguishing or throwing it on subsequent turns costs an action.\n\nProduce Flame is a Spell in Baldur's Gate 3. Produce Flame is a Cantrip from the Conjuration school. Spells are regulated forms of magic energy that can be used for dealing damage to Enemies, inflicting Status Effects, buffing Characters, or interacting with the environment. While casting usually Spells uses up Spell Slots, the number of which a character has is increased as the character increases in spellcaster Classes' levels, Cantrips are Spells that can be cast without using up Spell Slots. To balance this out, Cantrips usually are weaker Spells, that are mainly used as utility both inside and outside of battle. That being said, Cantrips can prove to be powerful depending on how a character uses them.\n\nBG3 Produce Flame Information\n\nDescription: A flame in your hand sheds a light in a 9m radius and deals 1~8 Fire damage damage when thrown. Throwing the flame immediately after you conjure it does not cost an action. Extinguishing or throwing it on subsequent turns costs an action. Level: Cantrip School: Conjuration School Casting Time: Action Requires Concentration: No\n\nHow to Acquire Produce Flame in Baldur's Gate3\n\nProduce Flame can be acquired by the following classes and races: Cleric, Druid Asmodeus Tiefling Produce Flame can be cast by using the following Items: Scroll of Flame Blade\n\nCleric, Druid Asmodeus Tiefling\n\nScroll of Flame Blade\n\nHow to Use Produce Flame in BG3\n\nProduce Flame is mainly a utility ability that's used for illuminating an area near the caster that otherwise might be too dark to see. As an added bonus, while this Cantrip is activated, the Druid should find an additional Action in their list aside from the Action to dismiss the flame, called Produce Flame: Hurl. This Action will have the Druid hurl the blue flame to an area within the range of nine meters. Any Enemies that are hit by this Action will be taking a small amount of fire damage. As far as simple Cantrips go, Produce Flame is a good one to have as it provides both utility and a little bit of damage, whereas others might just provide one or the other. Produce Flame could be used in conjunction with the likes of Flame Blade or Flaming Sphere, especially through juggling these Spells around for some visibility in the dark instead of having to prepare Darkvision. Produce Flame could also compensate for not having these Spells for this function, in favor of preparing others instead. As the other options will come on the Druid's later levels, Produce Flame is a viable choice for your first level if you plan on traversing some dark Locations early on.\n\nProduce Flame Tips & Notes\n\nThe spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8) and 10th level (3d8).\n\nCantrips Acid Splash ♦ Blade Ward ♦ Bone Chill ♦ Dancing Lights ♦ Eldritch Blast ♦ Fire Bolt ♦ Friends ♦ Githyanki Psionics: Mage Hand ♦ Guidance ♦ Improved Minor Illusion ♦ Light ♦ Mage Hand ♦ Minor Illusion ♦ Poison Spray ♦ Ray of Frost ♦ Resistance ♦ Sacred Flame ♦ Selûne's Dream ♦ Shillelagh ♦ Shocking Grasp ♦ Thaumaturgy ♦ Thorn Whip ♦ True Strike ♦ Vicious Mockery",
