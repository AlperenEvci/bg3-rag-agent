Halflings have a +2 Dexterity Score. While creating your Character in Baldur's Gate 3, you can choose between 11 different types of Races. Each of them has their special characteristics.\n\nBG3 Full Game Note: In the full launch of Baldur's Gate 3, Ability Score Points for Races that were present in Early Access are removed. And instead, Ability Score Points in the full game correspond with the Class players will choose.\n\nSmall yet capable, halflings prefer the comforts of home and hearth - but their natural luck and dexterity makes them fine adventurers.\n\nHalfling Traits:\n\nBase Racial Speed Brave: You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened Lucky: When you roll a 1 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.\n\nHalfling Subraces:\n\nLightfoot Halfling\n\nNaturally Stealthy: Your nimble nature makes you skilled at concealment. You have advantage at Stealth checks.\n\nStrongheart Halfling\n\nStrongheart Resilience: You have an advantage on saving throws against Poison and resistance to Poison damage.\n\nHalfling Tips & Notes\n\nDuring Early Access, the Halfling race used to feature +2 Dexterity. This has been changed in the full launch of BG3 and the Ability Score points are now associated with the Class that players will choose. ??\n\nRaces and Subraces Asmodeus Tiefling ♦ Black Dragonborn ♦ Blue Dragonborn ♦ Brass Dragonborn ♦ Bronze Dragonborn ♦ Copper Dragonborn ♦ Deep Gnome ♦ Drow ♦ Drow Half-Elf ♦ Duergar ♦ Dwarf ♦ Elf ♦ Forest Gnome ♦ Githyanki ♦ Gnome ♦ Gold Dragonborn ♦ Gold Dwarf ♦ Green Dragonborn ♦ Half-Drow ♦ Half-Elf ♦ High Elf ♦ High Half-Elf ♦ Human ♦ Lightfoot Halfling ♦ Lolth-Sworn Drow ♦ Mephistopheles Tiefling ♦ Red Dragonborn ♦ Rock Gnome ♦ Seldarine Drow ♦ Shield Dwarf ♦ Silver Dragonborn ♦ Strongheart Halfling ♦ Tiefling ♦ White Dragonborn ♦ Wood Elf ♦ Wood Half-Elf ♦ Zariel Tiefling",
