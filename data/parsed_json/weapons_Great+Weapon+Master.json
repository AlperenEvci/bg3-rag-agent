This feat does not give an action but allows you to do an extra attack as a Bonus Action. When you land a critical hit or kill a target with ANY melee weapon attack, you can make another melee weapon attack as a bonus action on that turn. It's important to try and make the most out of each of your turns, trying to use your action, bonus action, movement, everything that you can possibly use if you need it. And this is a great way to give melee characters something to do with their bonus action if they don't have anything else. To negate the attack roll penalty, consider getting weapons that provide +X Weapons, Proficiency Bonus, Bless, or multiclass War Domain.
