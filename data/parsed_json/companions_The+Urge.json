To find out who you were, and get back being that glorious old butcher?\n\nReflect on your misbehaviour.\n\nThe Butler gave you another chance. Kill your darling.

Come back to yourself.\n\nThe Urge Walkthrough\n\nThe Dark Urge has an impulse to maim and kill, and sometimes you can't control it. You gain \"Split-Splatter\" advantage when lobotomising Us. During your first interaction with Gale, Dark Urge can cut off his hand by selecting the \"Fantasize about hacking off the hand.\" dialogue option. If you talk to the squirrel near the Druid Grove elevator, you will just kill it. If you inspired Alfira and let her stay at your camp, she will be dead at night. Scleritas Fel will appear after Alfira's death, and starts Dark Urge's personal quest The Urge. The Dark Urge can take advantage of Pandirna being secluded and paralyzed to murder her. The Dark Urge can choose to torture the bird that Nettie is curing. If side with goblins and romance Minthara, you can snap her neck after your character sleeps with her. When you find a Moonlantern to keep yourself protected in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, you'll realize that there's a pixie trapped inside. You can decide to crush her after she's freed. If you unleash your urge and kill Isobel the Cleric, the ward that protects Last Light Inn will fail. Killing everyone there and fail lots of quests. If you allow Shadowheart to kill Nightsong, the ward will also fail and kill Jaheira and Isobel the Cleric off-screen. This will count to satisfy the urge. If you fail to control your Slayer Form, you may kill your Lover. Other notes, tips, and trivia for The Dark Urge go here.\n\nHow to unlock The Urge\n\nEvents are multiple and random.
