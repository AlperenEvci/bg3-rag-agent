Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic can be acquired during Act 2. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3 and earn more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nFind Ketheric Thorm's Relic Walkthrough\n\nYou need to reach the Gauntlet of Shar from the Grand Mausoleum (Thorm Mausoleum). In order to reveal the passage, you need to press the buttons under the 3 paintings in the following order: Moonrise Towers, Grief, General. (You can find the clue in a book in that region.) You can acquire this quest in Gauntlet of Shar. In the initial chamber of Gauntlet of Shar, there is a small statue holding an orb. You'll get pushed back if you attempt to approach it. In order to solve this puzzle, you need to explore the side rooms and pull the levers to lower all the lanterns. Then interact with them to extinguish the light. When the room is completely shrouded in darkness, you'll see the pattern on the floor. Use only one character to crouch-walk and avoid the glowing lines. This lets you touch the orb to unlock the doorway. Balthazar can be found in the western chamber of Gauntlet of Shar, he's been sent here to collect a Relic for Ketheric Thorm. You can temporarily work with him, and pass a persuasion check to get the item to summon his golem. Now you need to collect 4 Umbral Gems and reach the inner Sanctum. One Umbral Gem can be acquired by defeating Yurgir (Quest Kill Raphael's Old Enemy). He can be found in the east part of the temple. You can ask him to recite his contract and find the loophole in it, and deceive him into killing his own minions, even himself. The Other 3 Umbral Gems can be Acquired by completing Sharran trials: Soft-step Trial: You need to skulk to the end of the maze without being spotted by the shadows. Using an invisibility spell and turn base mode works well. But be careful of the traps. You need to find a Soft-Step Key (on the table of a hidden room) or use lockpick to open the final gate. Alternatively, you can use Dimension Door to bypass this trial. Self-Same Trial: This trial forces you to fight a clone of your parties. To make the battle a lot easier, get naked before you offer blood to the ritual bowl, and reequip your team before the battle starts. The clone team has the ability to dip in and out of the shadows. And each time you hit a clone of a party member, that member will suffer a debuff reducing the ability scores. Kill the clone to remove that debuff. After the fight, you can pick Killer's Sweetheart ring on the floor. Faith-Step trial: The room will be plunged into darkness after you offered the blood, and you need to remember the location of the platforms to reach the Umbral Gem. However, you can use the Daylight spell to light the entire room or use Fly, or Dimension Door spell to reach the final platform. After you complete all 3 trials, keep venturing until you reach the Silent Library. After defeating the enemies, press the buttons to unlock the gate of the Treasure Room. Interact with the plinth and put the book Teachings of Loss: The Nightsinger on it. That book is the answer to \"What can silence the Nightsong?” (Disarm the trap before taking the book.) Once you Placed the right book, the door to Treasure Room will open. Inside, you can find the following: Dark Justiciar Helmet, Dark Justiciar Half-Plate, and the weapon to kill the Nightsong -- Spear of Night. Once you collect all 4 Umbral Gems, use the floating platform to reach Inner Sanctum.\n\nSoft-step Trial: You need to skulk to the end of the maze without being spotted by the shadows.
