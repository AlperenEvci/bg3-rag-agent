We should find out what happened to him. Maybe they'll have answers inside.\n\nInvestigate the House of Grief Walkthrough\n\nWhen you first arrive at Rivington, you can find a Shar's follower called Ferg Dogher (X:45; Y:-102), Shadowheart can learn that her parents are kept prisoners at House of Grief. The House of Grief is located northwestern corner of the Lower City (X:-246; Y:-9). Inside the house, let Shadowheart sit on the granite bench will lead to a cutscene of Mother Superior, Viconia DeVir. (Viconia DeVir is a companion of BG1 and BG2. If you bring Jaheira and Minsc with you, there will be more interactions.) Proceed into the Cloister of Sombre Embrace, you need to choose between Shadowheart or Sharran followers. Defending Shadowheart leads to a fight with Viconia and Sharran disciples. Surrender Shadowheart and Lady Shar's faithful will join you in Gather Your Allies quest. If you killed Viconia, you get Viconia's Walking Fortress, Viconia's Priestess Robe and Handmaiden's Mace. There is a priestess named Nocturne who used to be Shadowheart's friend, you can trade with her even after you fight Viconia. After the fight, you can pick up the silver key and take the Back Diamond in front of the altar to unlock the gate to the inner sanctum. After a cutscene of Shadowheart's parents, Shar, the goddess of Night and Darkness give her two choices. Let her parents die, or let them live but continue serving Shar. There's a Mirror of Lost in the inner sanctum. Offer a piece of memory to Mirror of Loss has a small chance of increasing your CHA by 1. If you passed the Religion check and pray to Shar, then offer another piece of Memory (or the Knowledge you learned from Thay Necromancy book), you have a small chance of increasing an attribute of your choice by 2. You can pass a deception check (20) to offer a fake memory of 20. Any attributes you lose can be cured by the Remove Curse spell.\n\nHow to unlock Investigate the House of Grief\n\nQuest Giver / Location\n\nInvestigate the House of Grief Rewards\n\nInvestigate the House of Grief Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
