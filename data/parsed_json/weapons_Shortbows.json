  "content": "Shortbows in Baldur's Gate 3 are pieces of equipment that are used to inflict damage against hostile characters such as Enemies and Bosses. Shortbows are Two-Handed Martial Ranged Weapons in BG3 that can only be two-handed, dealing 1-6 Damage without enchantments, the exception being the Makeshift Bow that deals 1-4 damage instead. They have a range of 15m, and they deal Piercing Damage. Being a Ranged Weapon, note that you have disadvantage on attack rolls with Shortbows while Threatened.\n\nMany Shortbows have unique properties, so you should read carefully what these do, and many also have Weapon Actions that can only be used if you are Proficient with Shortbows in BG3.
