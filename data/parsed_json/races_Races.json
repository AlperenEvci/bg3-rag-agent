BG3 Races are chosen during Character Creation, and each choice grants various buffs and effects that are exclusive to a certain race, as well as unique physical traits. Players looking to optimize their Builds will take into account character race as well as Background and Class. Below you can find the full list of all Baldur's Gate 3 Races, Sub-Races, and their special abilities, features, and possible attribute boosts.\n\nBG3 Full Game Note: In the full launch of Baldur's Gate 3, Ability Score Points for Races that were present in Early Access are removed.

The damage dealt in an area is based on the ancestry and players may only use this attack once until they complete a long rest.\n\nThe Dragonborn race is distantly related to a particular kind of dragon.

After Lolth was found guilty of high treachery, she was banished into the Underdark by her own elven kind, where she conquered the deep abyss and regained powers for herself. After millennia of war between the elves that caused endless bloody conflict, the other Elves have decided to turn all the Dark Elves, indiscriminately, into \"Drow\", into what they are today in Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nLolth-Sworn Drow\n\nRaised by Lolth's cult in the city of Menzoberranzan. this Drow race extols the virtues of their corrupt and merciless goddess.

Fueled by Underdark magic, those experiments left early duergar with psionic powers, which have been passed down to their descendants.

Dwarves, for example, would be naturally inclined to tankier and melee builds, as they come with bonus Dwarven Resilience and Proficiencies to Battleaxe, Handaxe, Hammer, and Lighthammer. It is important to note that not all choices made in Baldur's Gate 3 are done for battle or build purposes, however, so players should feel free to pick the race that they prefer for roleplay, aesthetics, or optimization objectives.\n\nThe full launch of Baldur's Gate 3 will feature a total of 11 races and a total of 31 subraces to choose from. Each of these subraces will offer a variety of traits for your character that can alter their Base Speed (move distance per turn), capacity to see in the dark, Cantrip (availability of Spells), and more.\n\nWhat are Subraces in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nSubraces are variations of a group, with notable distinctions in appearance and characteristics. Subraces feature additional lore and in some cases, intrinsic alignments that may impact your relationship with other races during the course of the game. Subraces can also help players by giving their characters a direction through traits. The traits of each of the subraces are unique to another and can suit a certain\n\nThis is part of the world of D&D, and you can explore what effect your race has by checking out Backgrounds and tags.\n\nWhy are Races Important in BG3?\n\nWhen choosing your Race and Subrace some factors to look at such as the different dialogues and the element of role-playing, but the most important component is the Racial Features. First, it's important to mention that in the full release of Baldur's Gate 3, Ability Score Points for Races that were present in Early Access have now been removed, giving the player complete freedom to choose the race they want that better correlates with the selected Class. Moving forward, these Ability Score Points instead are now associated with the class players will choose.\n\nTake the time to read the description for each Race and Subrace you'll select to better understand its Racial Features. For example, some races such as Elves or Gnomes have Darkvision, allowing the character to see clearly in dark areas. This a very useful feature for new players as you will tread multiple locations and most likely fight enemies in the dark. Another factor to consider when it comes to Racial Features is movement speed, and in Baldur's Gate 3, some races are capable of moving farther than others in combat. An example would be choosing a race with great movement speed if you are playing a class that excels in melee combat, this way, you can reach and attack your targets easily without wasting a turn.\n\nMechanical Considerations: Pay attention to the racial traits, abilities, and proficiencies that come with your chosen race. These can complement your class and playstyle. Think about how your race's attributes align with your desired character build. For example, if you plan to play a melee fighter, a dwarf's natural resilience and weapon proficiencies may be advantageous.\n\nRacial Proficiencies are another factor to consider when choosing your Race in Baldur's Gate 3. A good example is for some players, who choose to play as a spellcasting class like Sorcerer, Wizard, or Warlock, but they want to be able to wield melee weapons such as Shortswords or Longswords. Selecting races such as the Githyanki provides proficiency in wielding the said weapons, making your character proficient in using spells and melee weapons.\n\nRaces and Subraces provide a selection of traits, and racial features, including proficiencies, base speeds, night vision, and more. Race choice in Baldur's Gate 3 will also make a difference in your dialogue options, NPC interactions, treatment, and race-unique scenes. These are some of the things that players would want to consider during character creation if they are going for a specific playstyle.\n\nNon-Playable Races in BG3\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, there are some races that are non-playable or available in Character Creation. You'll encounter these other races as you explore and we would like to indicate them below:\n\nBugbear: These hair goblinoids are fond of violent actions, they prosper in the heat of battle, often seen raiding, hunting, or ambushing their targets. Bugbears are sensitive to sunlight, medium in size but have a bulky build, they are also capable of seeing in the dark, making them a dangerous race to encounter. Gnolls: Gnolls are hyena-like humanoid creatures who excel in scavenging and stacking odds in their favor for successful hunting. No battle tactic is off-limits to a gnoll pack, and to face one is to know unbridled carnage. Goblins: Goblins are considered the most adaptable and resourceful humanoid races in the world, you can find them almost anywhere and where they are weak, they make up for in terms of being cunning intelligent beings and cooperating with their group. A single Goblin can pose no threat, but they can be a force to reckon with if you are outnumbered. Hobgoblins: Unlike Goblins, Hobgoblins are large that have orange and reddish skin. They are also cunning and resourceful, but they are much stronger as they value strength and martial expertise above anything else. Hobgoblins are skilled combatants who are capable as well of seeing their targets in the dark. Kuo-Toa: Monstrous fishlike humanoids that are short, pale, and covered in slimy scales. They have been driven underground by humans and their ilk who've become crafty individuals filled with madness. They are swift creatures who use the dark to their advantage to prey on their victims. Mind Flayer: Also known as Illithids and referred to as Ghaik by the Githyanki, wields psionic abilities and uses telepathy to communicate. They are feared by most creatures across many worlds as they abduct life beings to control them and ultimately mutate them as their own Mind Flayers are lethal beings since they consume their victims by extracting and devouring their brains. Ogres: As descendants of giants, these tall beings are usually seen with features of large torsos, muscular arms, bulky heads, and disproportionate limbs. Ogres are fierce and chaotic in nature within their tribes while some are generally solitary or join a civilized society if they are depicted as small and weak ogres. Redcaps: They are the most evil type of Fey you'll ever likely meet, Redcaps are lethal as they are known to be psychotic killers who enjoy killing and inflicting pain. Even though they are small, these blood-lust creatures have formidable strength that they use to hunt down their prey.\n\nDialogues and Interactions in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, dialogues and interactions play a pivotal role in enhancing the immersive storytelling experience. As you journey through the richly world, your chosen Race influences how characters perceive and respond to you, offering a diverse range of dialogues and role-playing opportunities.\n\nWhen engaging with NPCs, your character's Race often sparks unique conversations. NPCs may react differently based on your race, expressing curiosity, prejudice, or camaraderie. These interactions can provide valuable insights into the lore of the world and the dynamics between different races.\n\nFurthermore, your Race can open doors to specific quests, interactions, and even alternative solutions.
