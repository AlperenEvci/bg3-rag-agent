  "content": "Abilities in Baldur's Gate 3 are based on the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons which was implemented in 2014 and is the latest version of the famous pen & paper RPG. D&D uses a system that involves the rolling of a 20 side dice called a d20 to resolve encounters in scenarios in the game world. During the game this will be done behind the scene by the game software, but players are able to see the results of their dice rolls in the bottom corner of the screen.\n\nEvery four levels (levels 4, 8, and 12) in a given class you have the option to either allocate 2 ability points or choose one of the Feats. If you choose ability points then you can increase one ability by two points or two different Abilities by one point. You can't increase any ability above 20 using this feature. However, you can go over 20 in Abilities by using items.\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3 attributes are called Abilities Scores, this mean that Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma are all referred to as Abilities. Within the game’s mechanics and context this can be quite confusing at first, because just about every other role-playing game out there used the term abilities to delineate the skills of a character or some other active or passive function they possess. Attributes or Stats is usually what we would refer to these as, but in Baldurs Gate 3 they are called Abilities.\n\nEach ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)\n\nFor example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity have an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is superb at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding. The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Abilities\n\nInfluences your chance to land a hit (attack roll) and your damage with Strength-based weapons.

It also influences your chance of going first in combat (Initiative) and the enemy's chance of hitting you (Armour Class).\n\nConstitution influences your max numbers of Hit Points - the amount of damage you can take.\n\nWizards use Intelligence as their Spellcasting Ability - the likelihood spells will land.\n\nDruids, Rangers, and Clerics use Wisdom as their Spellcasting Ability - the likelihood spells will land.\n\nBards, paladins, sorcerers and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability - the likelihood spells will land.",
