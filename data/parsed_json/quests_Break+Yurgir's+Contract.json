Break Yurgir's Contract can be acquired during Act 2.\n\nThis quest takes place in the Shadow Cursed Lands, more specifically in one of the ruined hallways in the Gauntlet of Shar. This is done as an alternative subquest for the Kill Raphael's Old Enemy main quest.\n\nCompleting Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earn more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nBreak Yurgir's Contract Objectives\n\nInvestigate the Gauntlet of Shar for clues.\n\nThe orthon is bound by Raphael's contract and seeks a way to free himself from it.\n\nBreak Yurgir's Contract Walkthrough\n\nAfter exiting your dialogue with Yurgir circle back to the T-junction (X:-684, Y:-754) just outside of the alcove/hallway off-shoot where you meet the devil. With your back towards Yurgir veer to the right until you hit a broken floor. Look to your left and you'll find a descending path you can walk downwards with. Once you reach the bottom you'll notice a Cragged Rock you can interact with to travel even lower. Make two more jumps down and click on the next Cragged Rock you find. Hang right and you'll discover a book called \"One Becomes Many,\" a Cracked Helm of Shar, and a Broken Effigy (X:-709, Y:-723).\n\nInteract with the Broken Effigy. Regardless of whether you pass the passive Arcana check you'll be presented with a dialogue cutscene with one of the many rats you've seen throughout the temple. Using Speak with Animals on one of your party members, you'll want to then select the number 2 option \"You're no ordinary rat, are you? None of you are.\" Following the rat's response choose the number 2 option again, \"Are you telling me you're one person turned into a swarm of rats? How can that be?\" After which you can finally select the 1st dialogue choice, \"I don't usually bargain with rats. If I let you live, what's in it for me?\"\n\nThe rat will then offer to reveal the location of a secret stash of Sharran treasure. If want to find the hidden Sharran treasure he offers AND also kill him, then simply select the 1st dialogue option, \"All right. Your lives for this treasure. You'd better be level with me.\" However, it is highly encouraged you save before the start of the dialogue in general or somewhere during as landing a killing blow on the rat while it's running around after the dialogue has ended can be difficult and you only have one shot at initiating the combat encounter to complete the quest. Otherwise, all the rats in the temple will disappear, leaving the quest un-finishable.\n\nIf you're not concerned with the treasure then all you need to do is choose the 2nd option \"Attack.\" At this point combat will immediately initiate and you'll face off against a swarm of roughly 40 or so rats. Be mindful of the Soporific Rats if you're using melee characters, as the rat releases Narcoleptic Toxins upon death, which causes a Sleep spell to go off in a small radius around them. AoE spells and abilities or Magic Missile are extremely effective for this encounter.\n\nAfter killing all of them one of the rats will transform into the missing Dark Justiciar, Lyrthindor. He is a level 7 adversary with 112 hit points and no resistances. Be wary of his Sleep spell. You'll be asked to enter another dialogue. Here you're offered one final chance to back out of your hunt for the Dark Justiciar. But for the purposes of completing this quest just pick the \"Attack\" option and continue combat until the Dark Justiciar is dead.\n\nUpon his death make sure to loot his body; Lyrthindor will drop a Very Rare scimitar called Justiciar's Scimitar along with a Rare shield called Justiciar's Greatshield (item details below).\n\nKnow that upon completing the quest you will NOT receive the Infernal Metal as you would should you have chosen to kill Yurgir. Also, your relationship with Astarion will be all but jeopardized if earlier on you agreed to help him discover the meaning of the scars on his back via parleying with Raphael.\n\nHow to unlock Break Yurgir's Contract\n\nQuest Giver: Yurgir / Location (X:-650, Y:-754)\n\nBreak Yurgir's Contract Rewards\n\nRewards from Yurgir: Yurgir offers you anything leftover in his lair for you to scavenge, the most notable piece of loot being located in a chest (X:-633, Y:-719), which contains a Rare set of boots known as the Boots of Brilliance.

This can be done without using Speak with Animals if you pass an Animal Handling check. This sub-quest will be marked as completed by using this option, all the rats will disappear and you will have to kill Yurgir if you want to complete Kill Raphael's Old Enemy (and get the Umbral Gem next to him). Magic Missile and Spirit Guardians are the perfect choice of spells for multi-single target and AoE damage during the fight against the Swarm of Rats. Even if you failed to help Yurgir here, you can still persuade him to join your cause when fighting Rapheal in House of Hope.\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
