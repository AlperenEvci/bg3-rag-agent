This allows them to have better protection than the other bard subclasses. This Subclass, however, does not have access to a great ability like Cutting Words, and does not deal as much damage as the other ones. At level 3, College of Valour Bards learn Combat Inspiration. A powerful ability that buffs a single ally to add a +1d6 bonus to their next Attack Roll, Ability Check. Saving Throw, weapon damage, or Armour Class. Making it a very verstaile support cast At level 6, College of Valour and College of Swords Bards get an Extra Attack. Allowing them to perform two attacks during the same turn. This applies only after making an unarmed or weapon attack. NEW! - New Spells have been added to the Bard's Magical Secrets Spells List in Patch #1, released on August 25, 2023.\n\nALL BARD SPELLS IN BALDURS GATE 3\n\nAll Bard Spells Gallery\n\nBard Lvl 1 Spells\n\nSPEAK WITH ANIMALS\n\nANIMAL FRIENDSHIP\n\nDissonant Whispers\n\nTASHA'S HIDEOUS LAUGHTER\n\nBard Lvl 2 Spells\n\nCloud of Daggers\n\nCrown of Madness\n\nLesser Restoration\n\nPhantasmal Force\n\nSee Invisibility\n\nBard Lvl 3 Spells\n\nGlyph of Warding\n\nHypnotic Pattern\n\nBard Lvl 4 Spells\n\nFreedom of Movement\n\nGreater Invisibility\n\nBard Lvl 5 Spells\n\nGreater Restoration\n\nMass Cure Wounds\n\nBard Lvl 6 Spells\n\nOtto's Irresistible Dance\n\nBard Magical Secrets Spells\n\nArmour of Agathys\n\nConjure Elemental\n\nCrusader's Mantle\n\nGuardian of Faith\n\nMass Healing Word\n\nPass Without Trace\n\nRay of Enfeeblement\n\nSpirit Guardians\n\nSpiritual Weapon\n\nThunderous Smite\n\nWarden of Vitality\n\nClasses Arcane Trickster ♦ Archfey ♦ Assassin ♦ Barbarian ♦ Bard ♦ Battle Master ♦ Beast Master ♦ Berserker ♦ Circle of Spores ♦ Circle of the Land ♦ Circle of the Moon ♦ Circle of the Spores ♦ Cleric ♦ College of Lore ♦ College of Swords ♦ Conjuration School ♦ Divination School ♦ Draconic Bloodline ♦ Druid ♦ Eldritch Knight ♦ Enchantment School ♦ Fighter ♦ Gloom Stalker ♦ Hunter ♦ Illusion School ♦ Knowledge Domain ♦ Life Domain ♦ Light Domain ♦ Monk ♦ Nature Domain ♦ Necromancy School ♦ Oath of the Ancients ♦ Oath of Vengeance ♦ Oathbreaker ♦ Paladin ♦ Path of the Giant ♦ Ranger ♦ Rogue ♦ Sorcerer ♦ Storm Sorcery ♦ Tempest Domain ♦ The Fiend ♦ The Great Old One ♦ Thief ♦ Transmutation School ♦ Trickery Domain ♦ War Domain ♦ Warlock ♦ Way of Shadow ♦ Wild Magic ♦ Wild Magic (Barbarian) ♦ Wizard",
