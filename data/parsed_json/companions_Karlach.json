BG3 Karlach is found in The Risen Road, past the Blighted Village. She is a Zariel Tiefling Barbarian. See Hunt the Devil for Karlach's personal questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.\n\nI was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War. The eternal battle between bad and worse.\n\nWhere to find Karlach in BG3\n\nKarlach can be found in The Risen Road. Make your way through the Blighted Village, past the Gnome that is tied to the windmill, and jump across the gap in the bridge. Head down the road to your right, fight your way through the Hyenas and Gnolls, and continue down to the river where you will see blood on the ground and Karlach resting on the opposite side of the river.\n\nEARLY KARLACH SHORTCUT FROM EMERALD/DRUID GROVE\n\nIn Act I, Go to Zevlor's room named the Secluded Chamber, from there use the ladder going up where you will find a Tiefling Zentry and overlooking the Risen Road area. When you reach the cliff facing the Risen Road, to your right you will find a climable slope and at the top is a chest containing some items. Once you find the chest. In this Area, you can jump down to Karlach's area directly below and you can most likely see her at this point.\n\nEither get a character or characters that can survive the fall or if you have the Feather Fall spell, use it to negate Fall damage. You will land directly to the riverbank where Karlach is wounded and recruit her. After in which you can teleport back to druid's grove if you so wish.\n\nEasier way is to head to Scratch then to the log north-east. You will see river next to it. If you come to the edge, you will be able to jump onto the rock in the middle and then to the other side of the river. Next simply follow the river east, till you see blood on the ground, which will lead you to Karlach.\n\nKarlach's BG3 Special Feature\n\nKarlach can use Soul Coins to power up her mechanical heart, giving her the Infernal Fury condition, granting her additional 1d4 Fire damage on her attacks when raging or when her Hit Points drop below 25%. You can upgrade Karlach's mechanical heart twice in the game. Give her Heart of Iron condition (grants Karlach Advantage on Saving Throws against Charmed effects) and Heart Ablaze condition ( Grants Karlach Immunity to Charmed effects. She can now touch others without burning them).\n\nKarlach's BG3 Background\n\nKarlach is a Baldurian raised in a happy household in the Outer City. At one point, she got hired by Enver Gortash to act as his bodyguard. Later, however, he made a deal with the Archdevil Zariel, and sold Karlach to her for large amout of money in order to fund his plans for domination of the city. In Avernus, Zariel replaced her heart with an infernal machine, aimed to test the limits of machine and soldier.\n\nAfter ten years in the Hells, Karlach took the opportunity of Mind Flayer Nautiloid and escaped Avernus.\n\nKarlach's BG3 Starting Skill Proficiencies\n\nAthletics Perception Survival Intimidation\n\nKarlach's BG3 Starting Equipment\n\nArmour Boots Greataxe Crossbow\n\nBG3 Karlach Video Guide\n\nBG3 Karlach Build Guide\n\nBG3 Karlach Quest Walkthrough\n\nTo complete Karlach's questline, you'll first have to recruit her into your party. This can be done by exploring the Risen Road area, past the Blighted Village. Recruiting her will begin the quest:\n\nWARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\n\nHow to Romance Karlach in BG3\n\nIn this Karlach Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Karlach's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel.\n\nAdditionally, her background (as someone who just escaped the Hells) attunes her towards outgoing people who take actions that express their love of life. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.\n\nBG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act I\n\nYour relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.\n\nTo romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.\n\nAfter you move forward with her Companion Quest a little bit by\n\nBG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act II\n\nAct II will eventually allow you to progress further with the Companion Quest. For this to work, make sure to spare Nightsong during the events at the Gauntlet of Shar, as Dammon is one of the NPCs who will get affected by the consequences of letting her die, which can prevent you from bringing him Infernal Iron to help Karlach out. Assuming he's fine, in accordance with your actions, Dammon will also be in the Shadow-Cursed lands, which is where you'll also find the infernal items for Karlach. Bringing him one will help Karlach out with her physical condition. After bringing an Infernal Iron to him enough times, he'll finally be able to make it so that Karlach will be able to touch people. Afterward, all you'll have to do is rest at camp, as Karlach will be yearning for another intimate moment with you, this time going all the way. Try not to get too excited when you talk to Dammon before he creates the new upgrade so you don't miss out on the important status of Karlach's condition. Otherwise though, and as you've surely been since starting your relationship, you can remain as upfront as you'd like to be without fearing for any disapproval or negative outcome.\n\nBG3 Karlach Romance Guide Act III\n\nTo be updated when more information is available.\n\nKarlach Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nIf you are looking to befriend or romance Karlach, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nGeneral Personality Tips\n\nKarlach is both Violent and Compassionate. Though she is against evil acts, she is more than happy to choose violent actions that isn't evil. Being both Violent and Compassionate makes her the most liked person by all the origin companions. Karlach, Astarion and Lae'zel gains approval from acts of violence like starting fights. While at the same time, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Gale gains approval from Compassionate/Heroic actions. All companions, including Karlach gains approval if you defend her from people targeting her. In the confrontations with Wyll and Mizora about Karlach, choosing dialogue that tries to protect/defend Karlach will be liked by Every origin companion member. Karlach is a compassionate individual who disapproves of cruel actions. Thus would clash with Astarion and Lae'zel's Cruel tendencies Karlach approves of actions taken to the benefit of the Druid Grove tieflings and Heroic actions in general. Karlach consistently likes respecting surrenders. Will gain disapproval consistently if you keep executing prisoners or surrenderees. Karlach is distrustful of and generally hateful towards devils. Karlach wants her infernal engine heart repaired which needs Infernal Iron. There are multiple pieces of Infernal Iron in Act I/ the wilderness alone so this is a way to farm approval.\n\nCheck out our Companion Guide for all compiled approval instances\n\nNote this guide is a work in progress.

This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area. Then, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:\n\nSomeone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that? There has to be another way. I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer. I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it. This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.\n\nChoosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:\n\nWhy you? This isn't your sacrifice to make. Better you than me.\n\nChoose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:\n\nIf this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you. No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve. No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.\n\nChoose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.\n\nOrpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: \"My people will remember you, tiefling.\" despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode.\n\nNext, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice.\n\nKarlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nFree Orpheus Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus Betray Karlach during the final battle Must have The Dark Urge origin\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nFree Orpheus Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her Claim the throne in Bhaal's name\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nThis is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say \"This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing.\" Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.\n\nJust as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.\n\nKarlach Tips and Notes\n\nKarlach wishes to get revenge on the one who sold her into infernal slavery. She specifically mentions the fallen Solar current Archdevil Zariel. Zariel is the main antagonist of the DND adventure, Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus which also counts as a prequel to Baldur's Gate 3 as the Tiefling Refugees heading to Baldur's Gate is a direct effect of the Events of Descent into Avernus. Karlach has gone through multiple design changes over the years of early access. Each update she gets bigger. Previously known as an NPC but has been confirmed as an origin character and companion. Anders (before his VA was altered) mentioned how Karlach lost her horn through fighting demons, hence her title 'The Demonsbane'. If you kill a druid in the grove, she will not join you.
