Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help can be acquired during Act 1 as one of the methods to Find a Cure, a Main Quest in BG3. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earning more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nAsk the Goblin Priestess for Help Objectives\n\nFind the goblin priestess\n\nWe learned that a goblin tribe is led by a priestess with powerful magic. Dealing with goblins is risky, but this might be one way to cure ourselves.\n\nFollow Priestess Gut\n\nWe decided to trust Priestess Gut. If we follow her to her chapel, she'll examine the parasite.\n\nDrink Priestess Gut's potion\n\nNow that we have some privacy, Priestess Gut is prepared to assist us. All we need to do is drink a potion.\n\nQuest Complete Descriptions\n\nWe were drugged and imprisoned by Priestess Gut. She hopes that we'll turn into mind flayers so she can study us. We need to get out of here - now. Priestess Gut might have been able to help us, but being a goblin proved to be fatal for her. We'll need to find another way to remove the parasite. We've been marked as enemies of the Absolute - there's no way Priestess Gut will help us now. We repelled Priestess Gut's mental probe. Not capable of understanding what ailed us, she told us she couldn't help. We left the area without seeing if the goblin priestess could heal us.\n\nAsk the Goblin Priestess for Help Walkthrough\n\nAsk the Goblin Priestess for Help is a subquest for the Main Quest: Find a Cure\n\nHead into the Shattered Sanctum and you will find the High Priestess of the Absolute, True Soul Gut at the end of the hall and speak with her and she will ask you to hold out your arm so she can mark your flesh.

I'm here to spill your guts across the floor.\n\nYou find out she carries a parasite as well.
