She will offer Wyll a deal.\n\nHere, you will meet the sisters of Justice. Wyll wants to find and save his father so Mizora gives him two choices. She offers another bargain. Your two options are the following:\n\nIf the Grand Duke is alive, then she will reveal his location, but Wyll will pledge his soul to Mizora and the archdevil Zariel. (If the Grand Duke is dead at this point then Mizora will resurrect him.) The second option is to break his pact, but Wyll's father will die by his enemy's hand.\n\nWhen she appears with a proposal, the dialogue will proceed as follows:\n\nWhat are you proposing? Then break it already. Wyll doesn't need to wait six months. Remain Silent.\n\nAsk what he proposal is and she will elaborate.\n\nShould you break Wyll's Pact or save Wyll's Father?\n\nIf you remain pacted, your next objective will be to Rescue Ravengard from Gortash's secret prison.

Dimensional door and Teleportation Circle spells are very helpful, as well as the Potion of Speed.\n\nIf you turned down Mizora, she may appear once you free Duke Ravengard. Defeat her summoning, and don't let the explosion kill the duke.\n\nContinue to the Iron Throne. A cutscene will begin and the journals will update. When you arrive, a battle will begin.
