Alternately, climb the rocks outside the walls to the left of the gate, and jump up onto the roof. From there you can walk across and jump down into the tavern. Get inside the burning building, break down any broken doors blocking your way. Avoid the working door on the second floor. You'll be able to get at the chests inside from the doors ahead. There's a trapped man named Benryn inside the building. (quest Rescue the Trapped Man) He's behind the broken door nearest to the stairs. The other broken door on the second floor leads to the Counsellor, who you must speak to if you wish to advance the quest. From a goblin in their camp, you learn that the Grand Duke has been taken to Moonrise Towers. In Act 3, you can free Wyll's father whether or not you take Mizora's deals. In order to save duke Ravengard, you need to reach Iron Throne from Flymm Cargo. (Quest Save the Gondians and Avenge the Drowned will lead you to this location.)(Hatch to Flymm Cargo is hidden beneath some crates, at X-163, Y-143. Alternatively, you can reach Flymm Cargo basement through City Sewers.) You need to carefully select your team and spells before you reach Iron Throne. Once you land on Iron Throne, you will have only 6 turns to extract as many prisoners as possible. Dimensional door, and Teleportation Circle spells are very helpful, as well as Potion of Speed. If you turned down Mizora, she will appear once you freed the duke. Defeat her summoning, and don't let the explosion kill the duke. Once you escaped Iron Throne, return to camp to talk to him.\n\nSearch for survivors.\n\nThis event is triggered as you approach Waukeem's Rest. There is a burning inn ahead.Enter the burning inn and see if there are any survivors. Help Gauntlet Yeva push the doors to get through the wreckage into the burning building. If you do this successfully, you can search the area for survivors.\n\nAs you enter the burning inn, you should be able to encounter and save Counsellor Florrick. She's trapped beyond a broken door at Waukeen's rest, The Risen Road. You'll find Counsellor Florrick in one of the rooms upstairs. This will update the journal for: Rescue the Grand Duke.\n\nAct 1 Walkthrough\n\nSpeak with Counsellor Florrick.\n\nExit the burning building and a cutscene will the counsellor will soon begin. She thanks you for freeing her and tells you that the Grand Duke Ravengard, has been taken prisoner by the drows. She requests your help to rescue the Grand Duke. Agree to help to continue onwards. If you refuse, it will reflect in your journals.\n\nThe woman we rescued survived. Maybe she saw the Grand Duke?\n\nSearch for Grand Duke Ravengard.\n\nSpeak to her and agree to help then ask her additional questions for additional journal updates:\n\nWe learned that the Grand Duke was captured by drow and taken westwards. We agreed to look for the Grand Duke. We should investigate the area.\n\nAs you progress through the main story, you will eventually find yourself at the Moonrise Towers where you will subsequently begin the main quest: Infiltrate Moonrise Towers.\n\nWe reached Moonrise Towers. It seems unlikely that a high-value asset like Grand Duke Ravengard would be confined with other prisoners; the deeper we delve into the towers, the closer we'll be to finding him.\n\nMove through this location and you will only be able to see the Grand Duke from a cutscene when you enter the Mind Flayer Colony past the Barracks and the doors through the Necrotic Laboratory. Complete exploring Moonrise Towers as part of your main quests. You should be able to explore the area till you find the Necrotic Laboratory Flesh-Wrought Door. Once you enter, there will be a Neural Apparatus that you can interact with that will allow you to descend further.\n\nContinue to the next Flesh-Wrought Door to trigger the cutscene. You will find the Grand Duke, Gortash, and Orin and Ketheric Thorm. As you witness the scene, your journals will be updated.\n\nPursue Ravengard's captors to Baldur's Gate.\n\nGrand Duke Ravengard was infected with an illithid tadpole, and taken to Baldur's Gate.\n\nYou will need to follow him to the next location once you reach Baldur's Gate in Act 3. Progress through the main story questlines until you enter Baldur's Gate.\n\nWhile you are in the city, you will need to progress through the Main Quests and get through Get Gortash's Netherstone. Until you witness his ceremony. You will find him by Gortash as he is crowned the new archduke.\n\nWe finally found Grand Duke Ravengard - standing by Gortash's side as he crowned Gortash the new Archduke. He disappeared after the ceremony.\n\nAfter this event, speak to Mizora in the city and she will tell you that the Duke has been relocated. After this Interaction, take a rest at the camp when you are ready to trigger the next sequence.\n\nIf The Grand Duke is alive:\n\nMizora asked us to meet her in camp. She has an important proposal to make regarding Wyll's father, Grand Duke Ravengard.\n\nIf the Grand Duke died:\n\nGrand Duke Ravengard is dead. Wyll's patron, Mizora, awaits us in camp. Perhaps she can help.\n\nYou will be visited by Mizora at some point at Camp after a long rest. She will offer Wyll a deal.\n\nHere, you will meet the sisters of Justice. Wyll wants to find and save his father so Mizora gives him two choices. She offers another bargain. Your two options are the following:\n\nIf the Grand Duke is alive, then she will reveal his location, but Wyll will pledge his soul to Mizora and the archdevil Zariel. (If the Grand Duke is dead at this point then Mizora will resurrect him.) The second option is to break his pact, but Wyll's father will die by his enemy's hand.\n\nWhen she appears with a proposal, the dialogue will proceed as follows:\n\nWhat are you proposing? Then break it already. Wyll doesn't need to wait six months. Remain Silent.\n\nAsk what he proposal is and she will elaborate.\n\nShould you break Wyll's Pact or save Wyll's Father?\n\nIf you remain pacted, your next objective will be to Rescue Ravengard from Gortash's secret prison. If you break the pact, your next objective is to Continue onward with Wyll. Counsellor Florrick or Cordula Eltan will later ambush the party, while accusing Wyll of killing the father so he could take the city. Note: Before you make your choice, if the Duke does not need to be ressurected, it is possible to break the pact and later on find a way to save his father if you find him alive at the Iron Throne.\n\nYour response here will determine his choice.\n\nWhat will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact? Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild. Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live. Break the pact, Wyll. You deserve your freedom. Let your father die. When the city's free, you can take his place.\n\nMake your choice then continue.\n\nSearch for Grand Duke Ravengard.\n\nIf Wyll severed his pact with Mizora:\n\nWyll severed his pact with Mizora, even after she hinted that she could help locate and rescue Grand Duke Ravengard. It would seem the duke is as good as dead, but perhaps we might still find and save him.\n\nFind the secret command centre.\n\nWyll made a pact with Mizora and the archdevil Zariel in exchange for information about Grand Duke Ravengard's whereabouts. He is being held prisoner at Gortash's secret command centre.\n\nIn order to save Duke Ravengard, you need to reach Iron Throne from Flymm Cargo Lower City. (The Quests: Save the Gondians and Avenge the Drowned will lead you to this location.) You may need to progress through some main quests to gain access to the Lower City. This involves the quests: Investigate the Selunite Resistance and Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders, or Find the Suspicious Toys. Find your way into the Lower City then make your way to the Flymm Cargo. You may need to use Thieves' Tools to enter through the doors. This will begin a battle. After you've cleared the area, head to the basement. The Hatch to Flymm Cargo is hidden beneath some crates, at X-163, Y-143. Alternatively, you can reach Flymm Cargo basement through City Sewers.\n\nThere will be a door ahead to the Detention Block which will lead you to the Submersible that will take you to the Iron Throne. As you approach the submersible, someone may confront you- Redhammer the Deviser. Once you can respond, you can tell him that you need to get to the Iron Throne. Your interaction with him will update Save the Gondians. After you tell him where you are going, he will agree to take you in.\n\nNote: You need to carefully select your team and spells before you reach the Iron Throne. Once you land on Iron Throne, you will have only 8 turns to extract as many prisoners as possible and Escape to the submersible to dock before the Throne collapses. Dimension Door and Teleportation Circle spells are very helpful, as well as the Potion of Speed.\n\nIf you turned down Mizora, she may appear once you free Duke Ravengard. Defeat her summoning, and don't let the explosion kill the duke.\n\nContinue to the Iron Throne. A cutscene will begin and the journals will update. When you arrive, a battle will begin. You will start your journey in the middle of the map. To locate Duke Ravengard, head directly east. His location is circled on the Map below. Save the other prisoners to complete Save the Gondians.\n\nSearch for Grand Duke Ravengard & Lead Ravengard to safety.\n\nWe reached Gortash's underwater command centre, also known as the Iron Throne. We need to find Grand Duke Ravengard.\n\nYou will need to reach the Grand Duke then make your way back within the amount of turns you are given.

We need to lead him to safety.\n\nOnce you have escaped Iron Throne, talk to Duke Ravengard. He is overcome with a lot of emotions regarding his son when he sees him.\n\nHave a heart- your son is a hero. We saved lives here today, including your own. Grand Duke Ravengard, Glad to see you of your own mind. You can work out your issues later. Go to our camp - the Absolute can't reach you there.\n\nSpeak to Grand Duke Ravengard.\n\nGrand Duke Ravengard is safe at last. We should speak to him at our camp.
