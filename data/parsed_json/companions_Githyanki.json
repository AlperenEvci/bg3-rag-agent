Githyankis have an option of choosing their skill proficiency. While creating your Character in Baldur's Gate 3, you can choose between 11 different types of Races. Each of them has their own special characteristics.\n\nBG3 Full Game Note: In the full launch of Baldur's Gate 3, Ability Score Points for Races that were present in Early Access are removed. And instead, Ability Score Points in the full game correspond with the Class players will choose.\n\nGithyanki are peerless warriors from the Astral Plane, known for their legendary silver blades and red dragon mounts. They seek the total destruction of mind flayers, whose ancient empire enslaved the githyanki for millennia.\n\nGithyanki Traits\n\nBase Racial Speed: The distance you can move per turn is 9 m. Astral Knowledge Martial Prodigy Githyanki Psionics: Level 1: Githyanki Psionics: Mage Hand Once per Long Rest Level 3: Githyanki Psionics: Jump Once per Long Rest Level 5: Misty Step Once per Long Rest\n\nLevel 1: Githyanki Psionics: Mage Hand Once per Long Rest Level 3: Githyanki Psionics: Jump Once per Long Rest Level 5: Misty Step Once per Long Rest\n\nGithyanki Tips & Notes\n\nDuring Early Access, the Githyanki race used to feature +2 Strength and +1 Intelligence. This has been changed in the full launch of BG3 and the Ability Score points are now associated with the Class that players will choose. Githyanki statistics and racial traits make them effective Warlocks, Eldritch Knights or Wizards (see Circlet of Intelligence for the two latter which allows you to dump Intelligence), given the bonuses and proficiencies they get. Specifically, Wizards are capable of using medium armor, making Dexterity a less important ability score. They also make superb \"party face\" (main) characters given their Astral Knowledge feature.\n\nRaces and Subraces Asmodeus Tiefling ♦ Black Dragonborn ♦ Blue Dragonborn ♦ Brass Dragonborn ♦ Bronze Dragonborn ♦ Copper Dragonborn ♦ Deep Gnome ♦ Drow ♦ Drow Half-Elf ♦ Duergar ♦ Dwarf ♦ Elf ♦ Forest Gnome ♦ Gnome ♦ Gold Dragonborn ♦ Gold Dwarf ♦ Green Dragonborn ♦ Half-Drow ♦ Half-Elf ♦ Halfling ♦ High Elf ♦ High Half-Elf ♦ Human ♦ Lightfoot Halfling ♦ Lolth-Sworn Drow ♦ Mephistopheles Tiefling ♦ Red Dragonborn ♦ Rock Gnome ♦ Seldarine Drow ♦ Shield Dwarf ♦ Silver Dragonborn ♦ Strongheart Halfling ♦ Tiefling ♦ White Dragonborn ♦ Wood Elf ♦ Wood Half-Elf ♦ Zariel Tiefling",
