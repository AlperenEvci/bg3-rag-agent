Ask for loot on the corpses, and If you pass a Perception check (10), you can find something valuable on the bodies. The Duergar will ask you to lend them a hand or leave.\n\nBehind them, there is a big double iron door. You have to unlock it in order to enter. If you pass a Perception check at the end of the room, you will find a secret door, activate the button on its side, to open it and take the set of stairs up.\n\nBefore the stairs, you will find a chest on your right, you can loot an Arrow of Ice among other things, and head to your left. At the end of the hallway, there is another Perception check. By passing it, you will notice the loose stone.\n\nHead up and you will have take another Perception check, if you pass it, you will notice that an ambush is incoming. Three Ochre Jelly will come from the ceiling. Once defeated, keep going up through the stairs.

You can loot a Hand-drawn Map from a nearby backpack, to update the Quest Find the Explosives.\n\nMove deeper into the chamber to find Philomeen (X: -539, Y: 468), standing near a smokepowder barrel. She threatens you as you get near because she doesn't trust you. There are a few options to attempt to convince her otherwise.\n\nIf you fail to convince her, she will blow up the barrel, dealing massive damage and probably wiping your entire party out. But if you manage to convince her, she offers you Runepowder Vial, or you can simply attack her to attempt to take the whole barrel. If you kill her, you have to pass a Dexterity check (DC:20) when you interact with the barrel.\n\nThere are also explosives at (X: -587 Y: 390), behind a secret door.\n\nHow to unlock Find Explosives\n\nBrithvar gives you this quest in Grymforge, just past Sergeant Thrinn (X: -626 Y: 350).
