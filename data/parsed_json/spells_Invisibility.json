Invisibility will not break upon casting the Minor Illusion cantrip, or upon looting a container. Note that interacting with non-container objects WILL break the spell. The Duergar racial version of this spell has no duration, and can be cast for free an unlimited number of times outside of combat. However, it does not offer Stealth checks to allow its effect to be maintained after interacting with an object, casting a spell, or attacking. It will always break immediately. As of v4.1.1.4251417 of the game, there is a bug with the Level 2 version of this spell that makes it act the same way as the Duergar racial in regards to breaking immediately upon any interaction. It never offers Stealth checks to maintain the effect. Only Greater Invisibility offers such checks. Or perhaps the bug is that the Level 2 spell's tooltip is incorrect, and the entire line about stealth checks isn't supposed to be there.\n\nLvl 2 Spells Aid ♦ Arcane Lock ♦ Barkskin ♦ Blindness ♦ Blur ♦ Branding Smite ♦ Calm Emotions ♦ Chromatic Orb: Acid (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Cold (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Fire (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Lightning (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Poison (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Thunder (Lvl 2) ♦ Cloud of Daggers ♦ Crown of Madness ♦ Darkness ♦ Darkvision ♦ Detect Thoughts ♦ Enhance Ability ♦ Enlarge - Reduce ♦ Enthrall ♦ Eyes of the Dark: Darkness ♦ Flame Blade ♦ Gust of Wind ♦ Heat Metal ♦ Hold Person ♦ Knock ♦ Lesser Restoration ♦ Magic Weapon ♦ Melf's Acid Arrow ♦ Mirror Image ♦ Misty Step ♦ Moonbeam ♦ Pass without Trace ♦ Phantasmal Force ♦ Prayer of Healing ♦ Protection from Poison ♦ Ray of Enfeeblement ♦ Scorching Ray ♦ See Invisibility ♦ Shadow Blade (Spell) ♦ Shatter ♦ Silence ♦ Spike Growth ♦ Spiritual Weapon ♦ Warding Bond ♦ Web ♦ Whossa Large Fellow ♦ Zephyr Break",
