You can also make an Opportunity Attack when a target comes within range.

This feat is ideal to pair with Sentinel, and is a good way to be able to tank in Baldur's Gate 3, as is in DnD 5e. For Circle of Spores, the feat does not work together with Shillelagh. Both reactions will not roll their damage on WIS, but rather will do so on DEX/STR stats. Additionally, Symbiotic Entity's bonus necrotic damage do not apply as well. The Bonus Action attack can also scale off of Dexterity if it's higher. This is mostly relevant for Monks who are able to wield Quartersstaffs and Spears with DEX, including Pact of the Blade Warlocks who can't use CHA on the Bonus Action attack. The Bonus Attack deals minimal damage and the better benefit from this feat is the Opportunity Attack when combined with the Sentinel. When someone enters your attack range, you will get an Opportunity Attack while a reach weapon is equipped, and the Sentinel feat will be able to stop their movement before they get into their melee range of you (unless they also have a reach weapon). You can only do Polearm Clout (the Bonus Action attack) once per turn, even if you have two Bonus Actions from being a Thief. Polearm Clout will appear on your hotbar after attacking on your turn, and will disappear as soon as you use it. Attacking a second time with Extra Attack will not bring the Polearm Clout action back to your hotbar.\n\nAll Feats in Baldur's Gate 3 Ability Improvements ♦ Actor ♦ Alert ♦ Athlete ♦ Charger ♦ Crossbow Expert ♦ Defensive Duellist ♦ Dual Wielder ♦ Dungeon Delver ♦ Durable ♦ Elemental Adept ♦ Great Weapon Master ♦ Heavily Armoured ♦ Heavy Armour Master ♦ Lightly Armoured ♦ Lucky (Feat) ♦ Mage Slayer ♦ Magic Initiate: Bard ♦ Magic Initiate: Cleric ♦ Magic Initiate: Druid ♦ Magic Initiate: Sorcerer ♦ Magic Initiate: Warlock ♦ Magic Initiate: Wizard ♦ Martial Adept ♦ Medium Armour Master ♦ Mobile ♦ Moderately Armoured ♦ Observant ♦ Performer ♦ Resilient ♦ Ritual Caster ♦ Savage Attacker ♦ Sentinel ♦ Sharpshooter ♦ Shield Master ♦ Skilled ♦ Spell Sniper ♦ Tavern Brawler ♦ Tough ♦ Unstable Blood ♦ War Caster ♦ Weapon Master",
