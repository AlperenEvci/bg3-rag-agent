  "content": "Multiclassing is a feature in Baldur's Gate 3, which gives players a chance to further deepen the customization of their characters. Classes are styles of play that players can choose from for their characters. Characters take on these Classes from the start of the game and then develop and get stronger, gaining new strengths and improving as they go. Eventually, players can further specialize into Subclasses for their characters. Separate from this, Multiclassing then entails mixing and matching different classes together in order to gather the different strengths and playstyles of different classes into a single character for the player to be able to enjoy and experience. This is in no way a requirement to go through and complete the game, and players are able to respec or completely remove this facet from their characters when they reach a certain NPC early on in the game.\n\nBG3 Early Access Warning: Not all Classes will be available at the start of early access, but all Classes will be in the game at the launch of the full game. Multiclassing is not available on the early access version. Rules and concepts behind Multiclassing may also be different upon full release.\n\nWhy Multiclass in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nAs previously said, Multiclassing brings with it tons of different ways that players can customize their characters. Players who tend to get immersed more in the game's combat aspect will be able to enjoy a variety of different ways to command the battlefield, with new capabilities for their characters that single-class characters would not have. Players who tend to get immersed more in the story and roleplaying aspects of the game will be able to enjoy dialogue and event choices of all the Classes that they choose to Multiclass for their characters, with certain limitations of course as set by the game. Furthermore, Multiclassing allows characters to reach great heights of power brought about by synergistic properties between different Classes.\n\nWhat do I need to Multiclass in BG 3?\n\nWhether or not you want to plan ahead for your character, and see how some combinations of Classes work, you'll need a good handle on what each Class does and the way they progress.\n\nYou can visit our Classes page here.\n\nYou can also watch the following for overviews of different Classes to play based on their similar playstyles:\n\nBG3 Multiclassing Guide\n\nBG3 Class - Rogue vs Ranger\n\nBG3 Class - Sorcerer vs Warlock vs Wizard\n\nBG3 Class - Fighter vs Paladin vs Cleric\n\nVideo Guides for Baldur's Gate 3\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Paladin Multiclassing Guide & Ranking\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Rogue Multiclassing Guide & Ranking\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Warlock Multiclassing Guide & Ranking\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Monk Multiclassing Guide & Ranking\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Fighter Multiclassing Guide & Ranking\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Bard Multiclassing Guide & Ranking\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Sorcerer Multiclassing Guide & Ranking\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Ranger Multiclassing Guide & Ranking\n\nMulticlassing Guide for Baldur's Gate 3\n\nHow to Multiclass in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nAs Baldur's Gate 3 does follow the 5e system of Dungeons & Dragons for the most part players initially thought that Multiclassing would have the prerequisites it does in 5e - namely, characters would have to reach certain Ability Score numbers for certain Abilities associated with the Class in order to Multiclass into that Class. In Baldur's Gate 3, however, any and all prerequisites have been done away with, in favor of allowing players to be able to better customize their characters as early as they can. As such, players can easily start experimenting on or implementing Builds as early as when their characters first level up. To do so, players simply have to click the small Multiclass icon at the top-right corner of the level up tab showing the various things the character has gained. The icon looks like an axe and a staff crossed together. After clicking it, players can then choose from the list of Classes which Class they want their level to go to. Upon Multiclassing for the first time to a certain Class, the character will get the corresponding Equipment Proficiencies, as well as one Skill if said class is Ranger, Rogue or Bard.\n\nHow does Multiclass Work in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nMulticlassing presents a huge opportunity for players to create extremely strong powers, of almost unlimited capabilities. Most, if not all, capabilities of a different Class becomes accessible to them after all. The potency of Multiclassing can truly be seen when given an overview of the Actions and Spells that characters can learn under Classes. Most of the staple Actions or Spells are learned in the early levels. Therefore, Multiclassing, especially early on while the experience points required to go up a level is still low. This does, as all things, come at a cost. There are also certain rules and limitations that players have to consider in their endeavor to Multiclass their characters, which exist in order to effectively balance the game. After all, where's the fun in being able to just cast any and all spells that two magic Classes can learn, any time and for an infinite number of times? Take note, however, that these rules and concepts as assumed under the 5e system, and so may or may not turn out to be different when the game fully releases.\n\nMulticlass Leveling in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nCharacter Level: The moment characters level up, players are able to put that level into a different Class for Multiclassing. Which means, players effectively lose that level which would've been for the character's initial Class. The Character Level then becomes the sum of the levels put into each Class for Multiclassing. Proficiency Bonus, Ability Score Increase, and Feat Acquisition: Another concept to consider, as mentioned previously, is the fact that the experience points needed to gain a level increases relative to the player's Character Level, not the levels of their Classes. As such, certain milestone Class levels where characters would get Proficiency Bonuses (level 5 and 9), Ability Score Increase or acquire a new Feat (level 4,8, and 12; with an additional chance at level 6 for Fighters, and level 10 for Rogues), will take longer for players to reach. Subclasses: Similarly, specialization can become harder for characters to have the more they Multiclass, depending on their initial Classes.\n\nRules for Multiclassing in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nChannel Divinity: Channel Divinity can be learned by multiple Classes, with each having different effects. Multiclassing to another class and learning their Channel Divinity, while already having one of your own, does not increase the number of Channel Divinity Charges the character has. The character will be able to learn the effect of the new Class' Channel Divinity, but will not be able to stack the number of uses. Extra Attack: Multiple Extra Attack Features learned across multiple Classes (Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin, and Ranger) do not stack with each other. This means that unless stated specifically by a special aspect of that specific Extra Attack feature, characters cannot stack them to be able to attempt even more attacks. Unarmored Defense: Similarly, Multiple Unarmored Defense Features learned across multiple Classes also do not stack. This means that the benefits brought about by the Feature does not multiply regardless of how many times it is learned. Spellcaster Level: Characters Multiclassing in multiple spellcaster Classes have an extra hidden stat called their Spellcaster Level, which will determine the number of Spell Slots they will have at their disposal. A character's Spellcaster level is determined by adding together values determined by the specific spellcasting Classes or Subclasses they have levels in. The values for the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer and Wizard will be same as their Class level. The values for the Paladin and Ranger will be half of their Class level, rounded down. Finally, the value for spellcaster Subclasses will be one-third of their Class level, rounded down. For example, if the character is level 7 Arcane Trickster, level 2 Cleric and level 4 Paladin, then the values would be 2, 2, and 2 respectively. This character's Spellcaster Level is then 6. Spell Slots and Spellcaster Level: The number of Spell Slots Unlocked across different Classes when Multiclassing does not just easily stack on top of each other, allowing the character to cast countless number of Spells in a battle. If a character has levels in multiple spellcasting Classes and/or Subclasses, players have to first figure out their character's Spellcaster Level, and then they can consult a chart specifically created for this in the 5e System. Again, this chart, along with the Spellcaster Level mechanic, may or may not be applicable to the game upon release. Additionally, characters Multiclassing this way are able to use their higher-level Spell Slots to cast lower-level Spells, allowing for the Spell's enhanced effects if there is any.\n\nProficiencies Gained on Multiclass\n\nWhen you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new classâ€™s starting proficiencies, as shown below.
