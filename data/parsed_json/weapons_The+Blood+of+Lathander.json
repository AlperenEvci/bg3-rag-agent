The Blood of Lathander is one the best weapons the player can obtain early in the game, and it's recommended to be used by a healer who knows how to stay safe during combat. In BG3, each type of weapon has different ranges, damages, and other features (Finesse, Versatile, Dippable, etc.). Characters need to master certain Proficiency before using a weapon, and sometimes gain special Actions while holding it.\n\nThe large chunk of amber set into the handle of this luminous more supposedly holds four drops of godly blood fallen to the earth in a battle between an avatar of Lathander and a maddened Chosen of Mystra.\n\nBG3 The Blood of Lathander Information\n\nLathander's Blessing: Once per Long Rest, when your hit points are reduced to 0, you regain 2d6 (2~12) hit points. Allies within 9m also regain 1d6 (1~6) hit points.\n\nLathander's Light: Sheds holy light in a 6m radius. In combat, fiends and undead standing in the light are Blinded, unless they succeed a DC14 Constitution Saving Throw. 1d6 + STR Modifier + 3 Bludgeoning Weapon Enchantment +3 Sunbeam (Lvl 6 Evocation Spell, Recharge: Long rest.) Range: 1.5m\n\nBG3 The Blood of Lathander Location & Where to Find\n\nLocation: From Mountain Pass, head to Rosymorn Monastery, second floor into a hexagonal room with a puzzle. Not solving the puzzle won't exactly prevent you from getting the weapon, but by solving it, it will be much easier to get the weapon. The Monastery has 3 different levels. You must jump and climb vines to reach different parts of the Monastery. You can find Ceremonial Mace on a drunk Kobold on the first floor of the monastery. You can find Ceremonial Battleaxe after defeating the guardian on the second floor. Ceremonial Warhammer is on the top level, in the Eagle's Nest. (If you help the Blue Jay to take back the nest, he will reveal a loot location for you.) Place all ceremonial weapons on the right stand to acquire the Dawnmaster's Crest. If you attempt to take the Blood of Lathander without it, you will trigger the 4-turn countdown to the destruction of the entire Monastery. Warhammer -- Dawnmaster Seed Mace -- Dawnmaster Stockhold Battleaxe -- Dawnmaster Vaseid Longsword -- Dawnmaster Welkinglory Once all 4 ceremonial weapons are placed in the correct location, a hidden pouch will be revealed and your party will gain the Morninglord's Radiance condition.\n\nWarhammer -- Dawnmaster Seed Mace -- Dawnmaster Stockhold Battleaxe -- Dawnmaster Vaseid Longsword -- Dawnmaster Welkinglory\n\nAfter you defeated the inquisitor and returned from the Astral Plane. (Otherwise, Laezel may turn hostile.) Go to the statues on the left, turn one of them facing west and the other facing east (sunset and sunrise) to reveal the entrance to Secret Chamber. If the statue is stuck, use a Grease bottle on it or hit it with a blunt weapon. Be careful of the dawn breakers in the corridor, and attack the energy sources to disable the light barriers. When you reach the chamber, place the Dawnmaster's Crest in the panel to claim the Blood of Lathander. (without the Crest, you will be locked within light barriers. You will have to disable it and escape the monastery in 4 turns.)\n\nThe Blood of Lathander Notes & Tips for BG3\n\nRarity: Legendary Value: 640 Gp. Weight: 1.8 Kg. ID: 96a35552-0c05-4df0-9974-2a8f142e4be6\n\nBlood of Lathander trivializes the majority of Act 2 due to the amount of undead enemies you will face, the blind effect that gets applied subsequently shuts down all attacks of opportunity from undead, allowing you to combine it with Spirit Guardians (radiant type) while dashing through a lot of enemies to maximize the damage dealt.\n\nGive this to Shadowheart and make her part of the front line when facing undead, however, if your Custom Character is a Light Domain Cleric, it is preferred to make them carry it as they can benefit even further when combined with Warding Flare, making it downright impossible for the enemy to even hit you or your allies at all despite rolling the needed dice number to get hit, all boss fights in Act 2 are racial type of undead, and so their melee attacks will struggle the most while also being blinded limits their range of effectiveness against your party, Ketheric is also affected by the presence of the mace and will be blinded making you a great distraction for him to miss, while also force him to get out of its radius in hope to remove the blindness effect.\n\nSunbeam allows your cleric to deal superb amount of damage for a moment and blind a lot of dangerous enemies, despite its description saying that you can cast it again afterwards while concentrating on it, its not the case, this is a one time use cast and then you have to take a long rest to use it again, also be careful to not hurt your allies with it as it will damage everyone in its path.\n\nIn Act 3, Cazador, his servants and his vampire spawns also get affected by the mace, making fights easier to overcome, additionally its super useful in the House of Hope for the same reasons as it also affects fiends around the house, during the fight against Raphael, he, his trusted comrade(s) and his cambion servants will be blinded by the presence of the mace, do note it is extremely ill-advised to use Sunbeam because any form of radiant damage on fiends will backfire back at the caster as fire damage with each damage number dealt doubled, you will likely end up downing yourself more than benefiting from it.\n\nDespite Astarion being a vampire spawn and categorized as an \"undead\" he's unaffected by the mace presence, probably due to the tadpole.\n\nBug (as of Patch #2): Lathande's Blessing healing extends to enemies when it should be allies only. There's no saving throw against being Blinded.\n\nAll Weapons in Baldur's Gate 3 Adamantine Longsword ♦ Adamantine Mace ♦ Adamantine Scimitar ♦ Air Myrmidon Flail ♦ Allandra's Whelm ♦ Ambusher ♦
