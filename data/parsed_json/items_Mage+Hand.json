Permanent 18m Action\n\nConjuration Cantrip\n\nCreate a spectral hand that can manipulate and interact with objects.\n\nMage Hand is a Spell in Baldur's Gate 3. Mage Hand is a Cantrip from the Conjuration school. Spells can be used for dealing damage to Enemies, inflict Status Ailments, buff Characters or interact with the environment.\n\nMage Hand Information\n\nDescription: Create a spectral hand that can manipulate and interact with objects. Level: Cantrip School: Conjuration School Casting Time: Action Range: 18m Requires Concentration: Yes Saving Throw: None\n\nHow to Acquire Mage Hand\n\nMage Hand can be acquired by the following classes and races: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster, Swarmkeeper Githyanki, Mephistopheles Tiefling\n\nBard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster, Swarmkeeper Githyanki, Mephistopheles Tiefling\n\nMage Hand Tips & Notes\n\nFor Arcane Tricksters and Githanki, Mage Hand is summoned with invisible condition. Invisibility is broken when attacking. BUG: If Mage Hand is summoned within range of allied See Invisibility effects, it will force the invisible Mage Hand to make a saving throw to avoid being revealed the moment it's summoned, but will not have to save further. Outside of this specific scenario, the Mage Hand's invisibility behaves like any other form of standard invisibility. For Arcane Tricksters, Mage Hand can attempt to pick locks or disarm traps However, it will do so using its own stats and proficiencies, not the Arcane Trickster's,, making this a pretty poor usage of supplies. Mage Hand can 'move' light and medium objects. Mage Hand is immune to Poison gas cloud. 'Handy' for fetching Baelen's backpack after Baelen is gone. Mage Hand can use the SHOVE and THROW actions. The ability to use the THROW action means that, despite at first seeming very lackluster, Mage Hand is actually capable of providing exceptional support with a bit of planning and mindfulness. Splitting item stacks and dropping items requires no action, so players can pick a spot close to the fight to perch their Mage Hand, and place a selection of individual potions, poisons, grenades, water jugs, fireworks, or the like, and then leave the Mage Hand's side to reduce the risk that it's caught in an enemy AoE. The Mage Hand can then use its turns to throw whatever item you need from its stockpile. After combat ends, just remember to pick up whatever items are left in the Mage Hand's stockpile. Note that particularly dangerous items like fireworks and bombs are likely to tempt the enemy AI to try and detonate them with ranged attacks. While these items are perfectly usable by Mage Hand, in practice it's more reliable to supply the mage hand with less volatile items like potions, water jugs, or poisons so the AI is less likely to interfere. Provided the Mage Hand is safe, well-supplied, and well-stocked, the action economy of Mage Hand is a very good tradeoff compared to other healing or support spells. Being able to get this from multiple races and feats makes it possible for almost any build to assist with party support. Mage Hand is also available on all arcane spellcasters' spell lists, which in most cases makes it the sole \"healing\" spell in their repertoire. Mage Hand can now be summoned even while a summoned familiar is active.\n\nInvisibility is broken when attacking.
