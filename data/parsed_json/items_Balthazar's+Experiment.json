To earn her good favour, he'd be better off destroying it.\n\nBalthazar's Experiment Walkthrough\n\nHow to unlock Balthazar's Experiment\n\nQuest Giver / Location\n\nBalthazar's Experiment Rewards\n\nBalthazar's Experiment Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nCompanion Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 A Familiar Face ♦ Daughter of Darkness ♦ Decide Minthara's Fate ♦ In Case of Death... ♦ Our fiery friend ♦ The Blade of Frontiers ♦ The Chosen of Shar ♦ The Githyanki Warrior ♦ The Grand Duke ♦ The Hellion's Heart ♦ The High Harper ♦ The Pale Elf ♦ The Urge ♦ The Wizard of Waterdeep",
