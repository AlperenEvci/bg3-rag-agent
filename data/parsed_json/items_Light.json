When cast on an enemy, they make a DEX save to avoid it. Duration in this case is 20 turns. If the caster of this spell removes it from their prepared spells list, the spell's effect will end immediately. For any non-summon spell that lasts until Long Rest, the caster does not need to be in your party once you leave camp as long as the spell does not require concentration. Therefore, you can easily cast this spell on any party members you plan to use while leaving the caster back in camp. Differences from D&D 5th Edition: In 5E, light lasts for an hour, which would equate to 600 Turns\n\nCantrips Acid Splash ♦ Blade Ward ♦ Bone Chill ♦ Dancing Lights ♦ Eldritch Blast ♦ Fire Bolt ♦ Friends ♦ Githyanki Psionics: Mage Hand ♦ Guidance ♦ Improved Minor Illusion ♦ Mage Hand ♦ Minor Illusion ♦ Poison Spray ♦ Produce Flame ♦ Ray of Frost ♦ Resistance ♦ Sacred Flame ♦ Selûne's Dream ♦ Shillelagh ♦ Shocking Grasp ♦ Thaumaturgy ♦ Thorn Whip ♦ True Strike ♦ Vicious Mockery",
