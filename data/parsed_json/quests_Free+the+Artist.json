  "content": "Free the Artist Type Quest Act Act 1Act 3 Location Zhentarim Hideout Reward EXP\n\nFree the Artist is a Quest in Baldur's Gate 3. Free the Artist can be acquired during Act 1. You'll need to reach the Zhentarim Basement where you can find the Artist held captive. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3 and earn more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nFree the Artist Walkthrough\n\nAt the Zhentarim Hideout, descend the platform where you spoke to Zarys and converse with a painter named Brem. He offers to create a portrait of you using his pet artist, for a fee. You can respond with:\n\nA 'pet artist'? I do present well. I'll take one. No, thanks - just interested in trading. Leave.\n\nChoose the first option, and Brem will explain how he acquired the painter, emphasizing the arrangement benefits both of them. He offers to sell you the painter, with a hint of reluctance to entertain threats. You can respond with:\n\nVery well, I'll purchase him. What's the cost? [Intimidation] We can bypass threats and engage directly in combat. [Persuasion] If his talent is as remarkable as you claim, he'll attract attention soon. [Rogue][Persuasion] Art is more valuable once the creator is dead. I can arrange that. Forget the artist - any other items for trade?\n\nSelect the third option, and with sufficient charisma, Brem will concede that the artist's recognition could be a concern. He provides you with the artist and you can engage in conversation with the artist, Oskar Fevras. Initially assuming you bought him, he inquires about the price but eventually dismisses the question and introduces himself. You can reply with:\n\nYou're not known to me. And I'm [name]. Great. When do I get my reward? Don't worry. 'The Oskar Fevras' didn't cost me a coin. What plans do you have with your newfound freedom?\n\nSelect the first option, and Oskar expresses gratitude for the introduction. He acknowledges his debt and that of his patron, provided she still wishes to wed him. The narrator briefly recalls a recent scandal involving a Baldur's Gate patriarch and a commoner. This prompts another update in your Quest Journal. Respond with:\n\nAre you the runaway groom of Lady Jannath? What's the backstory? I'm not interested in your romantic affairs - just my reward.\n\nOpt for the first option, and Oskar defends himself while briefly explaining the complications. Following the backstory, respond with:\n\nA truly difficult dilemma. What decision did you ultimately make? I'm only concerned about getting paid.\n\nChoose the second option, prompting Oskar to admit he never made a choice. Although fame and wealth suited him, thoughts of his first love still linger. He shifts the conversation to more immediate matters and mentions his intention to reward you upon returning to the city. He requests some coins to ease his journey discomforts. You can reply with:\n\nI don't have any coins to spare. I can spare a bit. (200) I'll provide you comfort by leaving immediately.\n\nSelect the second option, and Oskar expresses gratitude while ensuring you'll be rewarded upon meeting him in Baldur's Gate. This concludes with an update in your Quest Journal, indicating your next task is to find Oskar in Baldur's Gate. (Astarion, Shadowheart, and Lae'zel disapprove, while Karlach and Wyll approve).\n\nWhen you reach Act 3, visit Lady Jannath's Estate to continue this quest.\n\nWhen you enter the Estate, you will notice that furniture is floating and hitting you. Cast see invisibility spell to spot poltergeists, beat them until you reached the rightmost room to see a haunted Oskar and Lady Jannath.\n\nNext, you need to reach Oskar's atelier on the top floor. Be careful there are Cursed Skulls that cast shockwaves to knock you back, you can cast remove curse or Disintegrate spells to destroy them in turn-based mode. Or use dimensional door/Misty Step to carefully evade them.\n\nIn Oskar's atelier, combine Oskar's painting with the easel to open the secret door in the Atelier.\n\nRead the letters in the secret room to find out Oskar was in love with someone else and asked the Mystic Carrion to help him.\n\nNext, you will need the Torch of Revocation which can be found in Mystic Carrion's house in the Lower City (X31, Y-166). You will need to either help Mystic Carrion find his missing servant (quest Find Mystic Carrion's Servant), collect all his jar of organs to defeat him, or steal the Torch from the gilded chest in the alcove behind him (DC25 Sleight of Hand). You may then use it to burn the painting in the atelier’s secret room. Afterwards, head back to the room where Jannath and Oskar are to decide the latter’s fate.\n\nFree the Artist Objectives\n\nHelp Oskar escape.\n\nWe met Oskar, an artist captured by the Zhentarim.
