Feats are special talents or expertises that provide special capabilities to characters. At certain levels, your character will get to choose between an Ability Score Improvement Feature or a Feat. (Note this feat is not available in EA and all info is subject to change.)\n\nAlert Information\n\nYou gain a +5 bonus to Initiative and can't be Surprised.\n\nHow to unlock Alert\n\nYou'll need to fulfill the following requirements to unlock Alert\n\nAll Classes at Level 4\n\nAlert Tips & Notes\n\nGiven how initiative works in BG3 (roll d4 as opposed to d20 in D&D5e), the Alert feat will virtually guarantee a character to go first in the initiative order in combat. This is particularly strong on Gloom Stalkers and Assassins. A low-Dexterity character will get more use out of the feat than one with very high Dexterity given the latter is likely to go very early in the initiative order even without Alert. Ideal to get on Shadowheart, or any Cleric with low DEX. This will allow them to go first and cast Bless before their first attack if you fail to precast it. The Level 7 Barbarian feature Feral Instinct, makes you immune to Surprise similar to Alert, making this feat less optimal. Works while in Druid Wild Shape.\n\nAll Feats in Baldur's Gate 3 Ability Improvements ♦ Actor ♦ Athlete ♦ Charger ♦ Crossbow Expert ♦ Defensive Duellist ♦ Dual Wielder ♦ Dungeon Delver ♦ Durable ♦ Elemental Adept ♦ Great Weapon Master ♦ Heavily Armoured ♦ Heavy Armour Master ♦ Lightly Armoured ♦ Lucky (Feat) ♦ Mage Slayer ♦ Magic Initiate: Bard ♦ Magic Initiate: Cleric ♦ Magic Initiate: Druid ♦ Magic Initiate: Sorcerer ♦ Magic Initiate: Warlock ♦ Magic Initiate: Wizard ♦ Martial Adept ♦ Medium Armour Master ♦ Mobile ♦ Moderately Armoured ♦ Observant ♦ Performer ♦ Polearm Master ♦ Resilient ♦ Ritual Caster ♦ Savage Attacker ♦ Sentinel ♦ Sharpshooter ♦ Shield Master ♦ Skilled ♦ Spell Sniper ♦ Tavern Brawler ♦ Tough ♦ Unstable Blood ♦ War Caster ♦ Weapon Master",
