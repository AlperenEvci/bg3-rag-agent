Forest Gnome has the ability to speak with animals. While creating your Character in Baldur's Gate 3, you can choose between 11 different types of Races. Each of them has their special characteristics and some of them have Sub-Races which provide different Features and Traits.\n\nBG3 Full Game Note: In the full launch of Baldur's Gate 3, Ability Score Points for Races that were present in Early Access are removed. And instead, Ability Score Points in the full game correspond with the Class players will choose.\n\nEven smaller than their cousins and twice as reclusive, forest gnomes are a rare sight in Faerûn. They master magic and craftsmanship in their distant, idyllic groves.\n\nForest Gnome Traits:\n\nDarkvision: Can see in the dark up to 12 m. Spell: Speak with Animals\n\nForest Gnome Tips & Notes\n\nDuring Early Access, the Forest Gnome race used to feature +2 Intelligence and +1 Dexterity. This has been changed in the full launch of BG3 and the Ability Score points are now associated with the Class that players will choose. ?? ??\n\nRaces and Subraces Asmodeus Tiefling ♦ Black Dragonborn ♦ Blue Dragonborn ♦ Brass Dragonborn ♦ Bronze Dragonborn ♦ Copper Dragonborn ♦ Deep Gnome ♦ Drow ♦ Drow Half-Elf ♦ Duergar ♦ Dwarf ♦ Elf ♦ Githyanki ♦ Gnome ♦ Gold Dragonborn ♦ Gold Dwarf ♦ Green Dragonborn ♦ Half-Drow ♦ Half-Elf ♦ Halfling ♦ High Elf ♦ High Half-Elf ♦ Human ♦ Lightfoot Halfling ♦ Lolth-Sworn Drow ♦ Mephistopheles Tiefling ♦ Red Dragonborn ♦ Rock Gnome ♦ Seldarine Drow ♦ Shield Dwarf ♦ Silver Dragonborn ♦ Strongheart Halfling ♦ Tiefling ♦ White Dragonborn ♦ Wood Elf ♦ Wood Half-Elf ♦ Zariel Tiefling",
