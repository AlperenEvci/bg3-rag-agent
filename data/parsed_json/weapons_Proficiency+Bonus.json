  "content": "Proficiency in Baldur's Gate 3 refers to the positive modifier applied to checks. The Proficiency Bonus is added to the Character's d20 rolls providing higher success chance in certain checks (and work somewhat similarly to Ability modifiers).\n\nProficiency Bonus\n\nThis bonus gets added to the following dice rolls: attacks, spell attacks, skills and saving throws you are proficient in.\n\nProficiency Bonus represents a character's skill and expertise in various aspects of the game. The bonus starts at +2 for low-level characters and increases as they gain experience, reflecting their growing competence.\n\nLevel 1-4: +2 Level 5-8: +3 Level 9-12: +4\n\nThe dice roll modifier is the same for all characters at the same level, regardless of Class or Race, but its application varies as follow:\n\nAttack rolls using Weapons you are proficient with. Attack rolls with Spells you can cast. Ability checks using Skills you are proficient with. Ability checks using Tools you are proficient with. Saving Throws you are proficient in. Saving throws DC for Spells you cast.\n\nNote that the Proficiency Bonus is not added to damage rolls.\n\nSkill Proficiency\n\nCharacters can acquire Skill Proficiencies which determine how good the character is at executing and passing certain tasks, each linked to a particular Ability. When performing the task, if a player is Proficient with the appropriate Skill, the bonus will be added to the d20 roll in order to beat the Difficulty Check.\n\nListed below are Skill Proficiencies found in Baldur's Gate 3, They are first determined by the Character's Race and Background, then selected among those available to their Class, finally additional proficiencies can also be acquired through a selection of Features and Feats.\n\nAthletics Acrobatics Sleight of Hand Stealth\n\nAnimal Handling Insight Medicine Perception Survival\n\nArcana History Investigation Nature Religion\n\nDeception Intimidation Performance Persuasion\n\nEquipment Proficiency\n\nSome Weapons, Armor or Tools require Proficiency to be used effectively. These proficiencies are Features that allow a Character's to use certain equipment pieces both without penalties and the Proficiency Bonus. Equipment Proficiencies are determined by the character's Class, Race and Feats.\n\nAny Character can still try to use any type of equipment, but if they lack the Proficiency they will suffer from certain penalties (for instance, using a non-proficient shield will hinder attack rolls, disabling any other attack proficiencies, despite providing the extra AC).\n\nWeapon Proficiency\n\nA creature can be proficient in entire categories of Weapons (Martial or Simple), or it can be proficient in specific weapon types such as Longswords, Longbows, etc. These proficiencies can be granted by the creature's Race, Class, or Feats chosen when leveling up.\n\nWhen a creature is proficient in a wielded weapon, they add their Proficiency Bonus to Attack Rolls with that weapon. When the weapon is equipped in the main hand, it also enables special properties and actions of that weapon type, such as Tenacity, Piercing Strike, Flourish, Lacerate, Pommel Strike, and so on.\n\nWeapon Proficiencies granted by Race and Class Racial Weapon Proficiencies Drow Rapiers, Shortswords, Hand Crossbows Dwarf Battleaxes, Handaxes, Light Hammers, Warhammers Elf Longswords, Shortswords, Longbows, Shortbows Githyanki Greatswords, Longswords, Shortswords Class Weapon Proficiencies Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger Martial Weapons, Simple Weapons Bard, Rogue Simple Weapons, Hand Crossbows, Longswords, Rapiers, Shortswords Cleric, Warlock Simple Weapons Druid Clubs, Daggers, Javelins, Maces, Quarterstaves, Scimitars, Sickles, Spears Sorcerer, Wizard Daggers, Quarterstaves, Light Crossbows\n\nArmor Proficiency\n\nA creature may have Proficiency in Light Armour, Medium Armour, and/or Heavy Armour.
