Since lost Companions cannot be brought back once they are lost, they can be replaced with Hirelings. Hire any combination of Hirelings including a Hireling party of all the same Class. This gives you additional options beyond the characters available from the Origins roster and gives you full control of the strengths and Classes in your party to create a customized party Build. If you prefer to, you can even have a full party of Hirelings.\n\nCan Hirelings be Customized?\n\nEach Hireling comes with a preset name, visual and Race. With the Magic Mirror update, these Hirelings can now be further customized except for their Race.\n\nAs of Patch #4, You can now customise hirelings' appearance when recruiting them.\n\nChoosing a Hireling in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nWhen recruiting Hirelings, you will be able to choose from a roster of 12, one from each of the Classes. Filling your party up with Hirelings allows players to customize their party dynamic so they can be filled with one type of class. So it is possible to have a party entirely made of up Barbarians or a party of Fighters for example.\n\nAll Hirelings in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nGold Dwarf - Barbarian\n\nEldra Luthrinn, slayer of people, monsters, and cups of sweet pear tea, was shown a watery grave when hunting Absolutists in the valleys of the Chionthar.\n\nBrinna Brightsong\n\nLightfoot Halfling - Bard\n\nBrinna Brightsong's bawdy crooning was silenced by an Absolute bloodbutcher after a controversial performance in a Triel tavern. on\n\nHigh Elf - Cleric (Selûne)Zenith, once an optimistic Evereskan Graycloak, journeyed to Faerûn in search of a new sunrise. An Absolute warband proved his dour fatther right: Zenith was doomed!\n\nMephistopheles Tiefling - Druid\n\nDanton was a refined druid and rearer of peacoks - until he thought transforming into one would help him escape Absolutist mauraders. He was wrong.\n\nVaranna Sunblossom\n\nWood Half-Elf - Fighter\n\nOnce a battle-worn veteran fighting for the Absolute, Varanna learnt that loyalty to the would-be god did not protect you from the murderous whims of jealous generals.\n\nGithyanki - Monk\n\nSina’zith’s monastic preferences marked her a misfit among her kin – as did the illithid tadpole an Absolutist forced in her mind. For this, the githyanki slew her as an aberration.\n\nHalf-Orc - Paladin\n\nKerz lived many years as a paladin and mercenary, years. which took a hard toll on them. befriending a group of pleasant ogres, they laid down their weapon and taught a rudimentary etiquette class, before the ogres were attacked one night, and Kerz once more took up their steel.\n\nLolth-Sworn Drow - Ranger\n\nVer’yll spent his twilights scribbling odes to leafy canopies, bushels, and the merits of the noble hedgehog. When he refused to join the Absolute, its forces tore his forest and body apart.\n\nMaddala’s blindness was cured by another True Soul passing through her village – so they could watch it being burnt to the ground around them. Such was the price of refusing the Absolute.\n\nDuergar - Warlock\n\nKree’s penchant for killing folk with a mere whisper was prized in the Absolute’s ranks, but the utter devotion to her patron was met with lethal disapproval.\n\nRock Gnome - Wizard\n\nSir Fuzzalump was much mocked amongst his playful kind for his dour demeanour and single-minded devotion to the magical investigation of cave moss. He claims not to have giggled in over a decade, and has never frolicked.",
