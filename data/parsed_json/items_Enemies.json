  "content": "Enemies in Baldur's Gate 3 present a lineup of various hostile characters in the game. Enemies are presented in all shapes and sizes, from creatures, humanoids, mythical beings, and much more. Even though each enemy is unique with its own behavior, killing Enemies grants various drops that reward players with items they will need as they continue to progress through the game. This page covers a list of all the enemies encountered in the game which includes their location, attributes, item drops, and more on each individual page that is linked below.\n\nEnemy AI is smarter than ever because Enemies employ more tactical strategies and they possess some features available to player characters. For instance, if Enemies are unarmed and they see a Weapon lying around nearby, they’ll grab it and attack you with it. You can use this scenario to your advantage by disarming your target beforehand. This pushes them into a situation where they’ll need to utilize Action Points just to run towards and equip a Weapon in order to hit you.\n\nFurthermore, enemy AIs are able to use their resources more efficiently. For example, they’ll carefully plan their next series of attacks so they can still have room to execute other actions like Dash or some Spells in the future. They can even use Throw to heal their party members from a distance by hurling Healing Potions at them, similar to how a player character would. Of course, these enhancements will be used by friendly NPCs as well.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Enemies\n\nCloaker Emperor Intellect Devourer Intellect Glutton Marcus Mind Flayer Rage Queller Spellplague Spectator Netherbrain The Snapping of Strings Unnatural Blot Weakened Mind Flayer\n\nAddled Frog Ancient Giant Eagle Bloated Hyena Chult Alioramus Crag Spider Cranium Rat Crimson D'hak Displacer Giant Eagle Hyena Nessa Shadow-Whiskers\n\nBao'Ek'nuk Bugbear Bugbear Assassin Grukkoh Scrawny Bugbear\n\nArcagh Artimetz Dhourn Filro the Forgotten Kar'niss Minthara Nere Viconia DeVir\n\nBrithvar Dalthar Torgga Thrinn\n\nKagha Quelenna Taman\n\nAkabi Air Elemental Air Myrmidon Ancient Mud Mephit Boney Earth Elemental Earth Myrmidon Fire Elemental Fire Myrmidon Lava Elemental Magma Mephit Stoney Water Elemental Water Myrmidon Yafeu Young Mud Mephit\n\nAuntie Ethel (Enemy) BOOOAL Meenlock Redcap Redcap Blood Sage Zethino\n\nBulette Doppelganger Ettercap Gilded Minotaur Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu Gnoll Flesh Gnawer Gnoll Hunter Gremishka Harpy Hook Horror Klaw Large Giant Spider Larger Giant Spider Mimic Minotaur Newborn Gnoll Owlbear Owlbear Cub Phase Spider Phase Spider Matriarch Phase Spiderling Slayer Small Klaw Smaller Giant Spider Tara Worg\n\nGoblin Booyahg Goblin Brawler Goblin Sharp-Eye Goblin Tracker Goblin Warrior Sharp-Eye Breg Torturer Spike Tracker Slice True Soul Gut Warrior Tiny Za'Krug Brakkal Devout Mezzka Krolla Lookout Fezk Lookout Grush Lookout Gruz Lookout Nozk Lookout Nrog Lookout Tizg Lookout Trinza Novice Bolt Novice Clack Novice Crusher (Enemy) Novice Cry Novice Gnat Novice Greez Novice Huk Novice Mrak Novice Muzul Novice Roo Novice Shekt Novice Tozad Rozzak Skrut Warlock Gurk Zurga\n\nEntombed Scribe Entombed Warrior Apostle of Myrkul Balthazar Benji Cazador Charismatic Sentinel Daddy Death Shepherd Echo of Abazigal Gerringothe Thorm Ghast Ghoul Godey Grim Visage Intelligent Sentinel Justiciar Avenger Justiciar Crusader Justiciar Nightweaver Justiciar Soulhunter Ketheric Thorm Malus Thorm Mommy Mystic Carrion Necromite Poltergeist Reconstituted Duellist Reconstituted Marksman Shadow Sister Lidwin Sister Sinda That Which Guards That Which Lurks That Which Watches Thisobald Thorm Winged Horror Wise Sentinel\n\nAndorn Cefrey Gandrel Haseid Mari Barton Cyrel (Enemy) Novice Kagran Novice Narvass Allandra Grey Fist of Bane\n\nButhir (Enemy) Chock (Enemy) Fank (Enemy) Lump the Enlightened (Enemy) Polma Guard Gurgon\n\nAnsur Qudenos Dominated Red Dragon\n\nLesser Hellsboar Lesser Imp Imp Cambion Zhalk Flind Merregon Legionnaire Hellsboar Yurgir Mizora Haarlep Gilded Imp Cursed Imp Raphael Sceleritas Fel\n\nGrym Animated Armour Arcane Turret Bernard Doggy Flesh Gerringothe Thorm Guardian of Faith Hellfire Watcher Hollow Armour Scrying Eye Steel Watch Steel Watch Titan\n\nA'jak'nir Jeera Ch'r'ai W'wargaz Ghustil Stornugoss Kith'rak Therezzyn\n\nGimblebock Warryn\n\nOchre Jelly Fetid Ooze\n\nAelis Siryasius Anders (Enemy)\n\nWood Woad Glut Mossy Myconid Noxious Myconid Restless Myconid Shadow Creeper Spaw",
