For any non-summon spell that lasts until Long Rest, the caster does not need to be in your party once you leave camp as long as the spell does not require concentration. Therefore, you can easily cast this spell on any party members you plan to use while leaving the caster back in camp. If the caster of this spell removes it from their prepared spells list, the spell's effect will end immediately. When Daylight is cast, it immediately removes any area of Darkness spell nearby, but a Darkness spell will remain if it is cast after a Daylight spell. Likewise, an item affected by Daylight (weapon carried by a character) will not remove any Darkness spell area and effect. In BG3, the most recent spell of Darkness or Daylight wins over, unlike the tabletop rules. Unlike the tabletop version, this is considered \"sunlight\" and will hurt Cazador and Vampire Spawns by dealing 20 radiant damage per turn. Astarion is completely unaffected by this due to the tadpole allowing him to walk in the sun completely unharmed. In the Shadow Cursed Lands, it will protect you from the curse and blind enemies in the presence of the Daylight similarly to Blood of Lathander. There are areas of the Shadow Cursed Lands where the spell might fail.\n\nLvl 3 Spells Animate Dead ♦ Beacon of Hope ♦ Bestow curse ♦ Blinding Smite ♦ Blink ♦ Call Lightning ♦ Celestial Haste ♦ Conjure Barrage ♦ Counterspell ♦ Crusader's Mantle ♦ Elemental Weapon ♦ Fear ♦ Feign Death ♦ Fireball ♦ Fly ♦ Gaseous Form ♦ Glyph of Warding ♦ Grant Flight ♦ Haste ♦ Hunger of Hadar ♦ Hypnotic Pattern ♦ Lightning Arrow ♦ Lightning Bolt ♦ Mass Healing Word ♦ Paralyzing Ray ♦ Plant Growth ♦ Protection from Energy ♦ Remove Curse ♦ Revivify ♦ Scorching Ray Shot ♦ Sleet Storm ♦ Slow ♦ Speak with Dead ♦ Spirit Guardians ♦ Stinking Cloud ♦ Summon Quothe the Raven ♦ Vampiric Touch",
