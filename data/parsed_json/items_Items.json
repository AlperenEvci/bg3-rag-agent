This primarily applies to Scrolls, Potions, Food, and Weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus. Merchants will reset their inventory if the player either levels up (the reset occurs when the player completes their level up, rather than on receiving sufficient experience) or if the player completes a Long Rest.\n\nResetting a Merchant's inventory will generate a new selection of items from their overall item pool, as well as restocking any non-randomised items the player has purchased. Certain items, generally those with unique names, are not restocked upon either leveling up or completing a Long Rest.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 All Items\n\nPotions Information\n\nBALDUR'S GATE 3 POTIONS COMPARISON TABLE\n\nQuick Search of All Potions\n\nFinal Product Effect Description Elixir of Heroism Gain 10 temp HP and become Blessed.
