Mauls are Two-Handed Martial Weapons in BG3 that can only be two-handed, dealing 2-12 Damage without enchantments. They have a range of 1.5m, and they deal Bludgeoning Damage, though some special Mauls also deal another type of Damage as well.\n\nMany Mauls have unique properties, so you should read carefully what these do, and many also have Weapon Actions that can only be used if you are Proficient with Mauls in BG3.
