The Great Old One's first unique feature Mortal Reminder allows to inflict the Frightened status effect when you land a critical hit. It may even inflict this status effect on several creatures, if they are close by the attacked one. This pairs great with Eldritch Blast, since it may be used to attack more than one objective. Entropic Ward, on the other hand, is a Reaction that can be used to impose disadvantage on attack rolls against you, but also, if said attack misses, grant you advantage on your attack roll against the attacker by 1 turn. At level 10, The Great Old One Warlocks earn Thought Shield: Psychic Resistance and Thought Shield: Psychic Reflection. The first one is a passive feature that grants them resistance to psychic damage, and the second one grants you the ability to inflict the same amount of damage to the attacker when you suffer psychic damage. This makes them a good subclass to deal with Mind Flayers Other Notes, Tips, and other Trivia for The Great Old One subclass go here.\n\nYou can search by Name, Level, School, Casting Time and Class.
