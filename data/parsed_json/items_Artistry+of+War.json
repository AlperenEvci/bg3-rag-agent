Each apparition strikes a target of your choosing, dealing 8~18 Force damage.\n\nCurriculum of Strategy: Artistry of War is a Spell in Baldur's Gate 3. Curriculum of Strategy: Artistry of War can only be learned from the scroll in Sorcerous Vault. Curriculum of Strategy: Artistry of War is a Lvl 5 Spell from the Evocation School. Spells can be used for dealing damage to Enemies, inflicting Status Ailments, buff Characters, or interacting with the environment.\n\nCurriculum of Strategy: Artistry of War Information\n\nDescription: Summon the apparitions of 6 master strategists. Each apparition strikes a target of your choosing, dealing 2d6 + 6 Force damage. Level: Lvl 5 spell School: Evocation School Range: 18m Requires Concentration: no Can't be cast in a higher spell slot. Can only be cast once per short rest.\n\nHow to Acquire Curriculum of Strategy: Artistry of War\n\nCurriculum of Strategy: Artistry of War can be cast by using the following Items:\n\nScroll of Artistry of War, found inside the book \"The Red Knight's Final Strategem\". The book is found through a door opened via finding a hidden button in the room where you enter the Sorcerous Vault below Sorcerous Sundries in the Lower City. Walk over the invisible walkways to find a locked Display Case containing the book. Read it to gain the scroll.\n\nCurriculum of Strategy: Artistry of War Tips & Notes\n\nDo not cast this scroll directly! Instead, teach it to a Wizard. They'll then be able to cast the spell an unlimited number of times. The total damage stated in the tooltip is incorrect. This spell deals 2d6+6 Force damage to each of up to six targets, or six times to a single target, for a total of 12d6 + 36, or 48-108 Force damage. Empowered Evocation affects each bolt individually, giving INT-mod x6 extra damage to this spell. With 20 Intelligence, this spell deals an additional 30 damage, for a total of 78-138 Force damage. Like Magic Missile, this spell's projectiles cannot miss. The tooltip states this spell offers an INT save to the target, but it doesn't. These properties make this far the most powerful attack spell in the game, though it is limited to a single cast per Short Rest, and it also cannot be upcast using a Level 6 spell slot.\n\nLvl 5 Spells Banishing Smite ♦ Cloudkill ♦ Cone of Cold ♦ Conjure Elemental ♦ Contagion ♦ Danse Macabre ♦ Destructive Wave ♦ Dethrone ♦ Dispel Evil and Good ♦ Dominate Person ♦ Flame Strike ♦ Greater Restoration ♦ Hold Monster ♦ Insect Plague ♦ Mass Cure Wounds ♦ Planar Binding ♦ Seeming ♦ Telekinesis ♦ Wall of Stone",
