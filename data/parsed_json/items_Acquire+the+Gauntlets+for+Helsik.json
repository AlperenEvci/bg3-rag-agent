Note that if you are caught thieving at any point, you will face Helsik, two gilded minotaur, and six gilded imps (May be more on Tactician). If you pass a DC 10 Deception check to tell Helsik you did not get the gloves, she will state you owe her the original fee proposed (20,000 gp) to enter the House of Hope. If you tell her you will not be paying her, either by refusing to or by not having the provided amount, she will be furious and her shop will be closed to you forever. You may avoid giving the gauntlets back by letting her know everything you took from the House of Hope is yours. She will originally be angry and state you had a deal. With a DC 10 Intimidation check, she will swiftly change her mind. This is the only method that you can use other than giving her the gauntlets where you can still purchase from her shop afterwards.
