BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.\n\nLae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.\n\nWhere to find Lae'Zel in BG3\n\nLae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight. (If you pick Lae'zel as your origin, another Githyanki Losiir will join your party.)\n\nShe will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map.\n\nShould you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.\n\nLae'Zel BG3 Starting Equipment\n\nGithyanki Half Plate Leather Boots Longsword Shortbow\n\nLae'Zel BG3 Starting Skill Proficiencies\n\nAthletics Acrobatics Survival Intimidation\n\nBG3 Lae'Zel Video Guide\n\nBG3 Lae'Zel Quest Walkthrough\n\nLae'Zel must be recruited into your party for her quest to begin. You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest:\n\nThe Githyanki Warrior\n\nWARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\n\nHow to Romance Lae'zel in BG3\n\nIn this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.\n\nTo gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.\n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I\n\nYour relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.\n\nYou're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!\n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II\n\nDuring a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - \"source of my bruises\" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.\n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act III\n\nAfter multiple long rests in Baldur's Gate, Lae'zel will take you to the rooftops to watch the sun together. She tlaks about how you changed her view on this world. In the end, she will ask you to stay with her \"when this is all over\", which the player can either accept or reject.\n\nDepends on your endings, your romance with Lae'zel will have multiple outcomes. Join the big fight against Vlaakith, or stay in Faerun and craft a new fate.\n\nLae'Zel Approval Guide in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nIf you are looking to befriend or romance Lae'Zel, you will have to get her approval. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nGeneral Personality Tips\n\nLoud and Direct. Will straight up tell you what she thinks and likes. Bloodthirsty and Cruel. Enjoys the subjugation of others, insults, and choosing violence. Very Mission oriented. Gain approval from refusing sidequests. Really hates getting sidetracked. It is really important to her that she handles all Githyanki-related affairs her way. Really enjoys pissing off Shadowheart and doing the opposite of what Shadowheart like most of the time. Sometimes they agree. Views Githyanki's principles and ideas as superior. Agreeing with her way of thinking gains approval. For example, hates pursuing every other method of removing the tadpole other than going straight to the Creche. Her few instances of \"Good Deeds\" that she approves are aligned with the principles of Militarism by Githyanki society. Martial Prowess, Self-Sacrifice, and Unwavering Duty. Arguably the hardest companion to gain approval as not only a lot of her instances are locked away into evil choices but also she just have the least amount of instances compared with all companions (Even Karlach). This part isn't defining the alignment of the Companion To avoid disapproval events, make sure the companion is Either left in camp or just far away from the dialogue.\n\nCheck out our Companion Guide for all compiled approval instances\n\nNote this guide is a work in progress.

This will result in Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:\n\nSomeone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that? There has to be another way. I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer. I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it. This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.\n\nChoose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected into Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:\n\nYou are a true hero. Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.\n\nChoosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself.\n\nLater on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid.

He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people.\n\nThen, you will get the following options:\n\nYou should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you. [PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.\n\nIf you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:\n\nYou don't deserve to die. You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you? Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.\n\nAgree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.\n\nJoin Orpheus into battle\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nReject the Emperor's offer to work together Free Orpheus Don't let Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nSimilar as the ending above, but this time don't let Prince Orpheus become the Mind Flayer, either let MC become the Mind Flayer, or ask Karlach to do so.

However, she will no longer be able to join your party.

After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.\n\nHelmet (metal) Githyanki Half Plate Gloves of Power (Branded) Metallic Boots Shortsword of First Blood and Absolute's Warboard (Branded) Once you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice Neck: Absolute's Talisman (Branded probably, Healing) Ring: Sunwalker's Gift (Scouting) Ring: Ring of Colour Spray (Defense) Any Heavy Crossbow +1 like the Githyanki Crossbow\n\nOnce you've expended the Warboard, switch to Sword of Justice\n\nCompanions Astarion ♦ Gale ♦ Halsin ♦ Jaheira ♦ Karlach ♦ Minsc ♦ Minthara ♦ Shadowheart ♦ Wyll",
