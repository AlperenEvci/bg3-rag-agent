Shillelagh is a Cantrip from the Transmutation school. Spells are regulated forms of magic energy that can be used for dealing damage to Enemies, inflicting Status Effects, buffing Characters, or interacting with the environment. While casting usually Spells uses up Spell Slots, the number of which a character has is increased as the character increases in spellcaster Classes' levels, Cantrips are Spells that can be cast without using up Spell Slots. To balance this out, Cantrips usually are weaker Spells, that are mainly used as utility both inside and outside of battle. That being said, Cantrips can prove to be powerful depending on how a character uses them.\n\nBG 3 Shillelagh Information\n\nDescription: Imbue your staff or club with nature's power. It becomes magical, deals 1d8+Wisdom Modifier Bludgeoning damage, and uses your Spellcasting Ability for Attack Rolls. Level: Cantrip School: Transmutation School Casting Time: Bonus Action Requires Concentration: No Duration: 10 turns\n\nHow to Acquire Shillelagh\n\nShillelagh can be acquired by the following classes and feat: Druid, Nature Domain Magic Initiate: Druid\n\nDruid, Nature Domain Magic Initiate: Druid\n\nHow to Use Shillelagh in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nShillelagh offers powerful offensive utility for the Druid, for players who prefer being melee fighters or combining melee combat with their ranged Spells. Using Shillelagh enchants whatever Weapon the Druid has equipped so that its damage stats get replaced by 1d8 in addition to the relevant Ability Modifier instead. Whenever the Druid attacks with this Weapon, the Attack Roll is instead influenced by their Wisdom Ability Score instead of Strength or Dexterity. This also becomes the relevant Ability Modifier that will be added to the damage dealt by the imbued Weapon. This makes Shillelagh a reliable source of damage, especially as Spells, the spellcaster's main source of damage and way of attacking, costs Spell Slots to cast, which are not infinite by any means. Shillelagh is also one of the best Cantrips to choose on the Druid's first level, especially since earlier Weapons may not deal as much damage yet. When used during a combat engagement, Shillelagh also uses up a Bonus Action, allowing the character to attack with the imbued Weapon on the same turn that it is imbued. The player can then simply do the same thing once the Spell dissipates in ten turns.\n\nShillelagh Tips & Notes in BG3\n\nNotes & Tips go here\n\nCantrips Acid Splash ♦ Blade Ward ♦ Bone Chill ♦ Dancing Lights ♦ Eldritch Blast ♦ Fire Bolt ♦ Friends ♦ Githyanki Psionics: Mage Hand ♦ Guidance ♦ Improved Minor Illusion ♦ Light ♦ Mage Hand ♦ Minor Illusion ♦ Poison Spray ♦ Produce Flame ♦ Ray of Frost ♦ Resistance ♦ Sacred Flame ♦ Selûne's Dream ♦ Shocking Grasp ♦ Thaumaturgy ♦ Thorn Whip ♦ True Strike ♦ Vicious Mockery",
