The Monk in Baldur's Gate 3 will focus on different Monk abilities that will vary in style across the different subclasses from elemental abilities and Spells, to ninja-like combat actions.\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, Monks employ a unique gameplay Actions mechanic. These Actions mimic spell effects, but their distinctive feature lies in their consumption of Ki Points.\n\nChannel your cosmic enlightenment by deftly dodging and efficiently disassembling your foes through stunning strikes and a whirlwind of martial art attacks.\"\n\nBG3 Monk Class Features\n\nHit Points at 1st level: 8 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 5 + Constitution modifier\n\nWeapons: Simple Weapons, Shortsword Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity, Skills: Choose 2 Skills from: Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, Stealth\n\nMonastic Robes, Monastic Boots Quarterstaff, Health Potion x2, Scroll of Revivify\n\nUnique Class Feature\n\nFlurry of Blows (Action): Using a Bonus action and a Ki Point, punch twice in quick succession.

Monks gain 1 additional Ki Point at each level after the 1st. Monks have Unarmored Defense like Barbarian, but with Wisdom and Dexterity affecting their Armor Class. Focus on Dexterity to maximize your unarmored benefits while also increasing your damage potential before moving to Wisdom. Way of the Open Hand is a good choice for beginners due to its versatile combat options. Way of the Shadow becomes more potent after gaining Shadow Step at level 6. Hold off on multi-classing your Monk until after level 5 to access their extra attack feature, which significantly boosts your damage potential. Choose Way of the Open Hand for control and debuffs, or Way of Shadow for stealth and teleportation abilities, based on your preferences. Activate Flurry of Blows to make 2 unarmed strikes as a bonus action while retaining all extra unarmed damage effects from items and feats.
