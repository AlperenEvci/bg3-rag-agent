Hiding while inside the cloud is automatically successful and will make it count as a Heavily Obscured area. The AI is currently too unsophisticated to deal with this and is likely to completely waste their turn. Cunning Action: Hide for hiding on a Bonus Action, coupled with Eversight Ring or Helldusk Helmet, or being Hasted and simply walking out of the cloud to attack and walk back in to hide, will allow you to exploit the AI. Can be used to remove Cloudkill and prevent it from being cast in the AoE.\n\nLvl 1 Spells Animal Friendship ♦ Armour of Agathys ♦ Arms of Hadar ♦ Bane ♦ Bless ♦ Burning Hands ♦ Challenge to Duel ♦ Charm Person ♦ Chromatic Orb ♦ Chromatic Orb: Acid (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Cold (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Fire (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Lightning (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Poison (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Thunder (Lvl 1) ♦ Colour Spray ♦ Command (Halt) ♦ Compelled Duel ♦ Create or Destroy Water ♦ Create Water ♦ Cure Wounds ♦ Disguise Self ♦ Dissonant Whispers ♦ Divine Favour ♦ Enhance Leap ♦ Ensnaring Strike ♦ Entangle ♦ Expeditious Retreat ♦ Faerie Fire ♦ False Life ♦ Feather Fall ♦ Find Familiar ♦ Find Familiar: Cat ♦ Find Familiar: Crab ♦ Find Familiar: Frog ♦ Find Familiar: Rat ♦ Find Familiar: Raven ♦ Find Familiar: Spider ♦ Goodberry ♦ Grease ♦ Guiding Bolt ♦ Hail of Thorns ♦ Healing Word ♦ Hellish Rebuke ♦ Heroism ♦ Hex ♦ Hunter's Mark ♦ Inflict Wounds ♦ Jump ♦ Longstrider ♦ Mage Armour ♦ Magic Missile ♦ Protection from Evil and Good ♦ Ray of Sickness ♦ Sanctuary ♦ Searing Smite (Spell) ♦ Shield ♦ Shield of Faith ♦ Sleep ♦ Speak with Animals ♦ Tasha's Hideous Laughter ♦ Thunderous Smite ♦ Thunderwave ♦ Witch Bolt ♦ Wrathful Smite",
