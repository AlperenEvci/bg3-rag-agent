Retrieve Omeluum can be acquired during Act 3. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earning more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nRetrieve Omeluum Objectives\n\nWe spoke to a hobgoblin called Blurg in the society of Brilliance Lodge. His illithid companion Omeluum is missing - we agreed to look for it.\n\nRetrieve Omeluum Walkthrough\n\nIf you sold the Githyanki egg in quest Steal a Githyanki Egg, the newborn githyanki will slaughter members of the lodge, blocking this quest. Omeluum is kept in Iron Throne as a prisoner. You can only reach the place from Flymm Cargo. (Quest Save the Gondians and Avenge the Drowned will lead you to this location.) (Hatch to Flymm Cargo is hidden beneath some crates, at X-163, Y-143. Alternatively, you can reach Flymm Cargo basement through City Sewers.) You need to carefully select your team and spells for this location. Once you land on Iron Throne, you will have only 6 turns to extract as many prisoners as possible. Dimensional door, and Teleportation Circle spells are very helpful, as well as Potion of Speed. Send one of your tank teammates to rescue him, and draw the attention of Sahuagin. Omeluum has a special spell that can teleport himself and one extra back to the sub, so don't worry about the time.\n\nHow to unlock Retrieve Omeluum\n\nRetrieve Omeluum Rewards\n\nOmeluum gives the following items: Wizardsbane Oil Fungal Bamboozler Scroll of Dimension Door Scroll of Sunbeam Potion of Supreme Healing\n\nWizardsbane Oil Fungal Bamboozler Scroll of Dimension Door Scroll of Sunbeam Potion of Supreme Healing\n\nRetrieve Omeluum Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
