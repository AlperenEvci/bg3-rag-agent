The easiest trigger be exploring the city sewers. The following companions may be kidnaped by Orin: Lae'zel Gale Halsin Minthara Yenna Orin's kdinap can be triggered during long rest, If Lae'zel is targeted, \"she\" claims Yenna is the shapeshifer and threats to kill her, before reveal herself to be Orin. If Gale is targeted, Orin transformed into him and threats to explode the orb and wipe out Baldur's Gate for the good of all. If Yenna is personated by Orin, she will kill Grub and cooked into the skewers. Orin's kidnap can also be triggeres during exploring the City Sewers, she can only kidnap someone who is not currently in your team. If you do not want to trigger the kidnap, avoid getting close to Undercity Ruins waypoint and the exit leads to Guildhall. Orin demands you kill Gortash (Get Gortash's Netherstone), if you don't want to face Gortash first, you can enter Murder Tribunal (Under Candulhallow's Tombstones, you can learn the clues from Investigate the Murders) and get the Amulet of Bhaal. In order to enter the Murder Tribunal, remove the Painting \"Buttefly on Skull\" in Candulhallow's Tombstones, then press the button. You need to hand in bag of hands from Dolor (Investigate the Murders) or the hand of Gortash to gain entry to Murder Tribunal. Or you can fight That Which Guards. In the Murder Tribunal, you will face Sarevok Anchev (Final Boss of BG1 and a Child of Bhaal), Echo of Sendai (Drow Bhaalspawn, boss of BG2:TOB ), Echo of Illasera (Bhaalspawn, boss of BG2:TOB) and the Echo of Amelyssan (final boss of BG2:TOB). Either prove to them you are a holy assassin of Bhaal by killing hollyphant investigator, Valeria. (And Minsc and Jaheira if they are with you.) Or defeat Sarevok (Lv 16 fighter).\n\nLae'zel Gale Halsin Minthara Yenna\n\nWith Amulet of Bhaal, open the gate to Bhaal's Temple (east to Undercity Ruins).
