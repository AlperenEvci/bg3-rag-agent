It also influences your chance of going first in combat (Initiative) and the enemy's chance of hitting you (Armour Class).\n\nDexterity is an Ability in Baldur's Gate 3. Each ability affects a broad range of capabilities, including Skills or Spells that a character or a monster can be proficient in.\n\nDexterity Information\n\nDexterity influences your chance to land a hit (Attack Roll) and your damage with Dexterity-based weapons. It also influences your chance of going first in combat (Initiative) and the enemy's chance of hitting you (Armour Class). Your Dexterity modifier also determines your initiative bonus. Initiative measures a character’s ability to act fast at the start of a battle, and it’s used to establish the order of turns in a fight.\n\nDexterity Checks\n\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks\n\nAcrobatics: Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. Sleight of Hand: Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Stealth: Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard Other Dexterity Checks: Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent Steer a chariot around a tight turn Pick a lock Disable a trap Securely tie up a prisoner Wriggle free of bonds Play a stringed instrument Craft a small or detailed object\n\nControl a heavily laden cart on a steep descent Steer a chariot around a tight turn Pick a lock Disable a trap Securely tie up a prisoner Wriggle free of bonds Play a stringed instrument Craft a small or detailed object\n\nAttack Rolls and Damage\n\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\n\nArmor Class (AC)\n\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\n\nYour Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however\n\nWithout armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + their Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the armor values.\n\nYour character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency. Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC.\n\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.\n\nDexterity Tips & Notes\n\nIn Other Languages\n\nDeutsch (Deutschland): Geschicklichkeit Español (España): Destreza Italiano (Italia): Destrezza\n\nAbilities Charisma ♦ Constitution ♦ Intelligence ♦ Strength ♦ Wisdom",
