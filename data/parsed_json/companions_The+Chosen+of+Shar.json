The Chosen of Shar can be acquired from Shadowheart during Act 1. Completing The Chosen of Shar will progress Shadowheart's story progression forward and is a subquest of The Daughter of Darkness.\n\nThe Chosen of Shar Objectives\n\nFind the Dark Justiciar's Lair\n\nShadowheart has shown interest in finding the lair of the Dark Justiciar - an elite force dedicated to her goddess Shar. We found murals in the grove that seemed to depict an ancient order of Sharran warriors - the Dark Justiciars. Further signs of their presence - historical or otherwise - may lie elsewhere. We found a finely sculpted idol of the goddess Shar, and decided to gift it to Shadowheart. She was greatly pleased; the discovery of such a piece bolstered her hopes of uncovering further signs of a Dark Justiciar presence. The Archdruid Halsin described how there was once an entire army of Dark Justiciars that waged war against followers of Selûne, long ago. The rites of becoming a Dark Justiciar are no mean feat - they must have had a substantial lair in order to train and anoint a force of such size. We found an ancient temple of Selûne that had seemingly been razed by Dark Justiciars in the past. Such a force must have had a stronghold to operate from. Perhaps it can still be found.\n\nExplore Grymforge\n\nWe entered the ruins of what may have been a fortress dedicated to the goddess Shar. We could be close to the Dark Justiciar's lair. We found the corpses of several Dark Justiciars - Shar must have been worshipped here. We found the corpses of several Dark Justiciars - Shar must have been worshipped here. Shadowheart suggested we search for answers. We found traces of Hellish fiends. Could they have killed the Dark Justiciars? If so, where is their temple of Shar?\n\nReach the Ancient Temple\n\nWe learned that Grymforge leads to an ancient temple. Perhaps the truth of what happened to the Dark Justiciars can be discovered there. The bridge to the ancient temple has been destroyed - there must be another way in. The cultists were trying to find an ancient temple, but the bridge has been destroyed. If we find another way in, we might discover what happened to the Dark Justiciars. It seems that there are limits to Shadowheart's resistance to the shadow curse - she is as vulnerable as anyone wherever the shadows are strongest. Perhaps her goddess tests her. A great many Dark Justiciars seem to have perished while fighting near the graveyard. We must be drawing close to the place Shadowheart wishes to find. We discovered that Shadowheart possesses a certain amount of resistance to the ill effects of the shadow curse. It seems that this must be due to Shar's patronage - but given the mercurial nature of the dark goddess, the extent of her protection remains to be seen. We discovered the remains of long-dead Dark Justiciars in the ruined town of Reithwin. It seems they fought to the death in an effort to defend something important to them.\n\nExplore the Gauntlet of Shar.\n\nWe discovered an ancient temple dedicated to Shar. This will be of great interest to Shadowheart - we should investigate further with her. We reached the place that Shadowheart had been seeking - an ancient temple dedicated to Shar. We should investigate further.\n\nComplete the trials of Shar\n\nShadowheart realised that this temple is the legendary Gauntlet of Shar - a proving ground where initiates would seek to become Dark Justiciars. After investigating an altar, she learned that a series of trials must be overcome in order to be anointed a warrior of Shar. Shadowheart wishes to complete the trials and become a Dark Justiciar herself.\n\nFind the Spear of Night\n\nShadowheart revealed to us that in order to become a Dark Justiciar, she must first acquire a weapon called the Spear of Night, hidden somewhere in the Silent Library.\n\nProceed with the trials of Shar\n\nWe have found the Spear of Night. Now we only need to clear the way to the Inner Sanctum of the Gauntlet of Shar, where Shadowheart seeks to be anointed as a Dark Justiciar.\n\nVenture into the Inner Sanctum.\n\nWe have cleared the way to the Inner Sanctum. Shadowheart is now very close to proving herself to Shar and becoming a Dark Justiciar. We should accompany her downwards. We have surmounted all the trials and cleared the way to the Inner Sanctum. Shadowheart is now very close to proving herself to Shar and becoming a Dark Justiciar. We should accompany her downwards.\n\nHelp Shadowheart finally become a Dark Justiciar.\n\nWe retrieved the Spear of Night. Now we only need to venture through the Inner Sanctum to where Shadowheart's final test awaits. If she succeeds, she shall be anointed as a Dark Justiciar. We have entered the Shadowfell - Shar's very own realm. We must descend to where a final test awaits Shadowheart. After praying to Shar, Shadowheart told us that she needs to proceed to where a final test awaits her. If she succeeds, she shall be anointed as a Dark Justiciar.\n\nDefeat Balthazar.\n\nWe have decided to turn on Balthazar. Now we must defeat him so that Shadowheart can deal with Nightsong. We have entered the Shadowfell - Shar's very own realm. We must descend to where a final test awaits Shadowheart. However, Balthazar, necromancer and ally of Ketheric Thorm, is also present, and may pose a threat to Shadowheart's ambitions if we do not intervene.\n\nShadowheart died. We won't be able to bring her back. Shadowheart left our party and won't return. We surrendered Nightsong to Balthazar, who took her away to Moonrise Towers. Enraged, Shadowheart turned on us. We convinced Shadowheart to turn her back on Shar's wishes, and instead free Nightsong. Rather than become a Dark Justiciar, Shadowheart will instead likely face dire consequences for her actions. We decided Nightsong's fate for ourselves, ignoring Shadowheart's wishes. This is bound to anger her greatly. Shadowheart wielded the Spear of Night and killed Nightsong. Greatly pleased, Shar rewarded Shadowheart, and gave her a new mission to pursue.\n\nThe Chosen of Shar Walkthrough\n\nThe Chosen of Shar is naturally updated as you progress through the Main Storyline with Shadowheart and continue to follow the objectives listed under her main Companion Quests: Daughter of Darkness. This quest begins after you rescue Halsin during Rescue the Druid Halsin.\n\nFind the Dark Justciar's lair\n\nShadowheart has shown interest in finding the lair of the Dark Justiciar - an elite force dedicated to her goddess Shar. The Archdruid Halsin described how there was once an entire army of Dark Justiciars that waged war against followers of Selûne, long ago. The rites of becoming a Dark Justiciar are no mean feat - they must have had a substantial lair in order to train and anoint a force of such size.\n\nAfter you saved Druid Halsin and killed all the goblin leaders, Halsin will suggest you travel to Moonrise Towers through the Underdark. He also mentions there's a group of Shar's Chosen in Underdark, which interests Shadowheart and updates the Journals for The Chosen of Shar. You will need to reach the Underdark which has more than one route. If you are following the Main Storyline, the Underdark will be the next location you can head to after rescuing Halsin for Rescue the Druid Halsin, one of your Main Subquests related to Find a Cure. To find Halsin, you can follow the steps here.\n\nReach the Underdark using one of the multiple routes. You can reach this location from the overgrown tunnel or Goblin Camp, Shattered Sanctum. In the Shattered Sanctum, there is a Door to the west to the Defiled Temple (X:392 Y:27), where there will be a puzzle room that you can get through. You may encounter Polma, the Bodyguard of the High Priestess. The dialog shows that a theft has been reported, and you are the only suspect. You are given the following choices:\n\nHand over the stolen items. Try to talk your way out of the situation. Perhaps a little gold could smooth this over? (652) Attack.\n\nNext, you will get another set of choices. Attempting the Intimidation check (Charisma) will require you to pass a DC of 15. Failing this will result in a battle against the Ogre.\n\nThere will be discs on the floor that will need to be aligned so that the black dots are collected on the lower circle. Solving this will open a passage ahead to the Underdark. Complete the area and when you move on, you'll be able to travel to Grymforge via the Underdark Duergar Boat at the Underdark Beach pier.\n\nIf you manage to reach the Dark Justiciar's lair -the Gauntlet of Shar without going through Grymforge, the Grymforge objective may be skipped. You will either be tasked to reach the ancient temple or explore Grymforge.\n\nWhen you Camp and rest in the Underdark, Shadowheart will continue to share her thoughts. Shadowheart will approach you and asks if it's a good time to share something. She will ask you to use the tadpole and communicate with her to come into her mind. You will now get the following options:\n\nAre you sure? What am I going to see? Use the parasite to explore her mind.\n\nUpon using the tadpole's power, Shadowheart begins to share a piece of her past, at the time that she was fleeing. A vision of a young Shadowheart came face-to-face with a Wolf as Lady Shar saved her and gave her a new home. Shadowheart tells you that she can't remember anything before that vision. With your knowledge, you recall a familiar Selunite rites of passage, about how they would send their children out into the wilds, to navigate their way home. You will get the following options to respond to Shadowheart:\n\nNo wonder you're so dedicated to Shar- you feel like you owe your life to her. You looked like you were wearing a Moonstone... isn't that commonly worn by Selunites? Thank you for sharing that with me. I know it can't have been easy.\n\nBack to the present time, and if you choose the 2nd option, Shadowheart dismisses this and tells you that you're reading too much into things. You can continue your conversation with Shadowheart to progress with the Daughter of Darkness quest, and you discover that Shadowheart was sent on a mission by her Mother Superior. This will also make progress in your relationship with Shadowheart if you choose to do so. Then, you get the next options:\n\nYou seemed intrigued when Halsin mentioned Dark Justicians before. I want to talk about your Shar worship. You and I... we share something special, I think. I want to talk about it. I want to talk about all that's happened to us. We should journey separately for now. I'll see you whenever we camp. Leave.\n\nYou can decide if you want to keep her in your party or have someone else take over. When you're done with your companion dialogues and quests in the Underdark, you will now continue to travel to Grymforge on the boat.\n\nExplore Grymforge\n\nNote: In order to fend off the Shadow Curse, ensure you have go through Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse in the Ruined Battlefield before you venture to the Grand Mausoleum. Once you have completed the ambush, you will be able to obtain the Moon Lantern. The Moon Lantern can also be inspected to obtain the Filigreed Feywild Bell which can grant part members the Pixie Blessing. Pixie Blessing Condition: The Shadow Curse cannot affect this creature thanks to a pixie's protective magic.\n\nThere are a few areas, Items and Locations that will trigger updates for the quest, The Chosen of Shar\n\nTravel to Grymforge, Shadowheart notices some there are bodies belonging to Shar's justiciars. You can find a small Shar statuette at Grymforge (X:-648, Y:362 ) and gift it to Shadowheart. You can find Night Orchid at Ruined Battlefield (X:54, Y:175) and gift it to Shadowheart. You can find clues of Nightsong once you reached Gauntlet of Shar. While exploring Grymforge you will find many skeletons clad in the same dark armor, which leads to Shadowheart comment that they were Dark Justiciars. As you stumble on a Metallic Mask, the Quest will be updated, as the group will reach the conclusion that some hellish fiends could have killed the Shar worshipers. Upon opening the doors past where Nere was trapped, you discover the bridge to the ancient temple has been destroyed - there must be another way in. You can find Night Orchid at Ruined Battlefield (X:54, Y:175) and gift it to Shadowheart.\n\nThese interactions throughout the Grymforge will record the following journals:\n\nWe found a finely sculpted idol of the goddess Shar, and decided to gift it to Shadowheart. She was greatly pleased; the discovery of such a piece bolstered her hopes of uncovering further signs of a Dark Justiciar presence. We entered the ruins of what may have been a fortress dedicated to the goddess Shar. We could be close to the Dark Justiciar's lair. We found the corpses of several Dark Justiciars - Shar must have been worshipped here. Shadowheart suggested we search for answers. We found traces of Hellish fiends. Could they have killed the Dark Justiciars? If so, where is their temple of Shar? We gifted Shadowheart a Night Orchid - her favourite flower. She was greatly appreciative of the gesture.\n\nYou will eventually be presented with the objective to Investigate the Gauntlet of Shar in Act 2\n\nReach the ancient temple.\n\nWe discovered the Gauntlet of Shar - a huge, ancient temple dedicated to the dark goddess. Shadowheart will surely want to investigate further.\n\nThe Gauntlet of Shar is a Location in BG3 encountered in Act 2. Your actions here will be recorded for a related Companion Quest: The Chosen of Shar. To reach the Gauntlet of Shar, you have to be within the Reithwin Graveyard in Grand Mausoleum.\n\nThe Mausoleum’s entrance can be found in the northwestern area of the Reithwin Masons’ Guild, at the graveyard. Raphael will be waiting for you near the entrance if you have the Quest Kill Raphael’s Old Enemy active, along with its corresponding part of the Companion Quest The Pale Elf. When you go through the iron fence, you’ll hear a talking skull telling you to beat it, but it won’t do anything else if you interact with it. A part of Ketheric Thorm’s diary sits near his diseased wife’s coffin. Other parts as scattered around this area if you want to look into his past. In the eastern area of this first area, you can find a locked Traveller’s Chest at (X:-259, Y:-882). It has a lockpicking DC of 14 and contains the Vivacious Cloak, some alchemy materials, some valuables, and possibly a potion or two.\n\nLoot the rest of the area as much as you’d like, and then head over to the northern section. The plaque here reveals that Isobel is Ketheric’s daughter and that the tomb here belonged to her. Successful Perception checks here will reveal traps on the vents and various tiles on the floor, as well as gargoyle heads on the walls, all around the room. In order to reveal the path, you need to press the buttons under the 3 paintings in a specific order. This order is listed below but can be obtained from a book in the area:\n\nStart with the button below the Moonrise Towers (X:-248 Y:-848) painting first Then the Grief (X:-278 Y:-842) painting beside it, Finally, the last button under Ketheric Thorm’s (X:-280 Y:-830) painting.\n\nAfter pressing the corresponding buttons, the walls beside the last painting will open up and allow you to pass through. You'll find a platform there with a Traversal Gem, interact with it to travel down the Gauntlet of Shar. There are 4 Umbral Gems in Gauntlet of Shar, you need to collect all of them in order to progress Shadowheart's personal quest, Daughter of Darkness: The Chosen of Shar.\n\nGauntlet of Shar\n\nWe discovered an ancient temple dedicated to Shar. This will be of great interest to Shadowheart - we should investigate further with her. We reached the place that Shadowheart had been seeking - an ancient temple dedicated to Shar. We should investigate further.\n\nIn the initial chamber of Gauntlet of Shar, there is a small statue holding an orb. You'll get pushed back if you attempt to approach it. In order to solve this puzzle, you need to explore the side rooms and pull the levers to lower all the lanterns. Then interact with them to extinguish the light. When the room is completely shrouded in darkness, you'll see the pattern on the floor. Use only one character to crouch-walk and avoid the glowing lines. This lets you touch the orb to unlock the doorway.\n\nIn order to complete the Gauntlet of Shar, you need to collect 4 Umbral Gems and reach the inner Sanctum.\n\nOne Umbral Gem can be acquired by defeating Yurgir (Quest Kill Raphael's Old Enemy). He can be found in the east part of the temple. You can ask him to recite his contract and find the loophole in it, and deceive him into killing his own minions, even himself. (If you want to side with Yurgir, you need to find the last alive Justiciar. Who has been turned into rats by Raphael. You need to find the Broken Effigy at Shar Statue's feet. Read the book and learn the Rats' story. Doing so can avoid the fight with Yurgir. And later easier to get his help when you sneak into Rapheal's House of Hope and confront the archdevil. Yurgir is also a potential ally in Gather Your Allies. But you can still persuade Yurgir to join you even if you killed him here.)\n\nComplete the trials of Shar\n\nShadowheart realised that this temple is the legendary Gauntlet of Shar - a proving ground where initiates would seek to become Dark Justiciars. After investigating an altar, she learned that a series of trials must be overcome in order to be anointed a warrior of Shar. Shadowheart wishes to complete the trials and become a Dark Justiciar herself.\n\nThe Other 3 Umbral Gems can be Acquired by completing Sharran trials:\n\nSoft-step Trial: You need to skulk to the end of the maze without being spotted by the shadows. Using an invisibility spell and turn base mode works well. But be careful of the traps. You need to find Soft-Step Key (on the table of a hidden room) or use lockpick to open the final gate. Alternatively, you can use Dimension Door to bypass this trial. Self-Same Trial: This trial forces you to fight a clone of your parties. To make the battle a lot easier, get naked before you offer blood to the ritual bowl, and reequip your team before the battle starts. The clone team has the ability to dip in and out of the shadows. Each time a party member hits a clone that is not their own, that member will suffer a debuff reducing all ability scores. Killing the clone will not remove that debuff, it lasts until the next long rest. After the fight, you can pick Killer's Sweetheart ring on the floor. Faith-Step trial: The room will be plunged into darkness after you offered the blood, and you need to remember the location of platforms to reach the Umbral Gem. However, you can use the Daylight spell to light the entire room, or use Fly or Dimension Door spell to reach the final platform.\n\nOnce you've completed the trials, continue heading south and at this location (X:-756 Y:-753) is the Silent Library. You'll notice there's a white barrier at the entrance, you can go through but you will be Silenced and you'll be unable to cast any spells. There will be several Justiciar enemies in the area, if you want to avoid combat, you can try to sneak attack them with ranged attacks. They don't seem to get triggered by getting damaged, which will make this section easier. Once you've slain all the enemies in the area, press the button on the far right corner of the room (X:-778 Y:-751) to unlock the gate to the Treasure Room. Once you enter the room, disarm all of the traps first, then look for the book called Teachings of Loss: The Nightsinger, then interact with the plinth and place the book. After placing the book, the door to Treasure Room will be opened.\n\nFind the Spear of Night\n\nShadowheart revealed to us that in order to become a Dark Justiciar, she must first acquire a weapon called the Spear of Night, hidden somewhere in the Silent Library.\n\nAfter you complete all 3 trials, keep venturing until you reached the Silent Library. After defeating the enemies, press the buttons to unlock the gate to Treasure Room. Interact with the plinth and put the book Teachings of Loss: The Nightsinger on it. That book is the answer to \"What can silence the Nightsong?”\n\nAfter you complete all 3 trials, keep venturing until you reached the Silent Library. After defeating the enemies, press the buttons to unlock the gate to Treasure Room. Interact with the plinth and put the book Teachings of Loss: The Nightsinger on it. That book is the answer to \"What can silence the Nightsong?”\n\n(Disarm the trap before taking the book.)\n\n(Disarm the trap before taking the book.)\n\nOnce you Placed the right book, the door to Treasure Room will be open. Inside there are Dark Justiciar Helmet, Dark Justiciar Half-Plate, and the weapon to kill the Nightsong -- Spear of Night. Once you collect all 4 Umbral Gems, Insert them into the Ancient Altar.\n\nWe have found the Spear of Night. Now we only need to clear the way to the Inner Sanctum of the Gauntlet of Shar, where Shadowheart seeks to be anointed as a Dark Justiciar.\n\nOnce you activate the floating platform, Shadowheart will interrupt and tell you to wait.\n\nWhat's wrong? This isn't another of your episodes, is it? Glance around.\n\nIf you ask her whats wrong, she will say nothing, but if you insist, she will say that she finally feels she's on the right track under Lady Shar's gaze.\n\nVenture into the Inner Sanctum.\n\nWe have cleared the way to the Inner Sanctum. Shadowheart is now very close to proving herself to Shar and becoming a Dark Justiciar. We should accompany her downwards. We have surmounted all the trials and cleared the way to the Inner Sanctum. Shadowheart is now very close to proving herself to Shar and becoming a Dark Justiciar. We should accompany her downwards.\n\nWhen you are ready, step on the newly activated platform ahead. Enter the Inner Sanctum to reach your next objective.\n\nComplete the trials of Shar\n\nShadowheart realised that this temple is the legendary Gauntlet of Shar - a proving ground where initiates would seek to become Dark Justiciars. After investigating an altar, she learned that a series of trials must be overcome in order to be anointed a warrior of Shar. Shadowheart wishes to complete the trials and become a Dark Justiciar herself.\n\nIf you didn't previously complete the rest of the trials, your objective here will be to complete the rest of the trails to obtains the next 3 gems and insert them in this Ancient Altar which requires 3 Umbral Gems. If you have the gems ready, insert them into the Ancient altar to open the Stone Doors ahead.\n\nHead in and you will discover a new Waypoint and you will have three platforms ahead representing the Gift of Mercy, the Gift of Darkness, and the Gift of Secrets. Go ahead. and interact with the Shadowfell Entrance to begin the next cutscene and introduce the final test. Shadowheart will need to Descend to the Nightsong, Make a sacrifice, and Rise again a Dark Justiciar.\n\nShadowheart will need to pray. You can respond with:\n\nShadowheart...? There'll be time to pray later - let's move. [WISDOM] Use the power of the parasite. Feel inside Shadowheart's mind. Leave her to her prayers.\n\nIf you use Wisdom and succeed you will feel the presence of Shar and you'll start to hear her communicate with Shadowheart. She will tell her to take the spear, step forward and strike down the Selunite. Shadowheart will disapprove of your choice to read her mind since that wasn't for you to hear.\n\nHelp Shadowheart finally become a Dark Justiciar.\n\nAfter praying to Shar, Shadowheart told us that she needs to proceed to where a final test awaits her. If she succeeds, she shall be anointed as a Dark Justiciar.\n\nBefore you proceed, a warning will pop up. Depending on your choices, the state of the region could change andsome active quests may become unavailable. Your actions here will also be recorded for the Journals of Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic.\n\nStep in through the Shadowfell Entrance to continue and a cutscene will begin. This will take you into the Shadowfell. You will also be greeted by Balthazar. You can confront him and respond from the following choices:\n\nI was hoping for something more substantial than 'thanks.' How did you get here? What is this place? I cleared the way to this place, not you. W Why shouldn't I just kill you instead of letting you interfere? Lead on, then. Attack.\n\nIf you choose option 1, he will eventually end the conversation and you can proceed through the Nightsong's Prison. Continue to descend. You should be able to use Jump to get to the lower platforms. Continue down following the Justiciar Soulhunter. Head all the way down and you will find Nightsong. When you can finally respond, you have the following options:\n\nWait - the Nightson is a person? What are you going to do to her? I can't let you take her, Balthazar. Attack him.\n\nYour choices here will decide the ending for the quest. The events that occur here will also update the journals for: Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic and Infiltrate Moonrise Towers. Refer to the endings to decide your next steps.\n\nThe Chosen of Shar Endings.\n\nAllow Shadowheart to become Dark Justiciar. You will need to have obtained the Spear of Night for this to be possible and you will need to defeat Balthazar. Shadowheart spares Nightsong. This will require your to attack Balthazar. This will lead Nightson to head for Moonrise Towers to kill Ketheric Thorm. Spare Balthazar and allow him to take Nightsong to Ketheric Thorm. He will explain that Aylin is an aasimar, bound to a soul cage of his creation to lend her power to General Thorm.\n\nView the steps below on how to achieve each ending.\n\nDefeat Balthazar - Ending 1 & 2\n\nThe first two endings will require you to defeat Balthazar. Face Nightsong without Balthazar by attacking him. When you face Nightsong, you will have the following options:\n\nTrust Shadowheart - do not interfere. Do as you must. Is this truly what you want? Choose your own way, Shadowheart. You cannot allow your goddess to control you. Please Shadowheart. Don't do this.\n\nChoose to trust her with the first option and Shadowheart will approve. You can follow up with the next options:\n\nKill her. Let's finish this ritual, [persuasion] Don't do it, Shadowheart. Don't kill her- you'll regret it. She knows something about you. Spare her, and see what she has to say. Say nothing.\n\nContinue with the ritual and encourage Shadowheart with the first response. Karlach will disapprove. This will result in Ending 1. Say nothing or tell Shadowheart to spare her during this interaction to get Ending 2 (Spare Nightsong). Telling Shadowheart to spare her will gain the approval of Karlach.\n\nEnding 1: Help Shadowheart finally become a Dark Justiciar.\n\nAllow Shadowheart to kill Nightsong with the Spear of Night and she will become a Dark Justiciar. Your next objective as part of the Daughter of Darkness quest will be to Defeat Ketheric Thorm.\n\nShadowheart wielded the Spear of Night and killed Nightsong. Greatly pleased, Shar rewarded Shadowheart, and gave her a new mission to pursue.\n\nEnding 2: Spare Nightsong\n\nIf you say nothing or tell her to Spare Nightsong during the dialogue, Shadowheart will decide herself to ultimately spare Nightsong leading to Ending 3. Shadowheart will ready her spear, but she will start to hesitate, and then throw away the spear. She'll then say Lady Shar will disown her. Shadowheart will then touch Nightsong to release her from her prison. Nightsong will then receive all her powers and armour back. She says Shadowheart has great power, but she will also need a powerful weapon. She then asks if she is ready. Nightsong will be headed toward the Moonlight Towers to go after Ketheric Thorm.\n\nWe convinced Shadowheart to turn her back on Shar's wishes, and instead free Nightsong. Rather than become a Dark Justiciar, Shadowheart will instead likely face dire consequences for her actions.\n\nFreeing the Nightsong will grant you Selune's blessing and a Moonlight Glaive. As you travel through the portal, Shadowheart goes out for a moment. She tells you that she heard Lady Shar's voice after she defied her. She has been abandoned by her goddess and allies. Powerless, she will now seek answers from Dame Aylin. Afterward, you now get the option to respond to Shadowheart as you please if you want to progress your romance with her.\n\nThe Chosen of Shar Ending 3: Surrender Nightsong to Balthazar\n\nIf you decide to go see Nightsong without attacking Balthazar, you have the following dialogue options:\n\nIf she's the reason Ketheric is invulnerable, you're not taking her. Leave, or you're a dead man. Go on, then. Take the Nightsong to Ketheric. Get it over with. Attack him.\n\nIf you choose option two and ask him to take the Nightsong to Ketheric, Wyll and Karlach will disapprove. Allow the next scene to play out and she will be released. This will inspire Shadowheart (Acolyte: Cerimonia Compedum) and complete the quest.\n\nWe decided Nightsong's fate for ourselves, ignoring Shadowheart's wishes. This is bound to anger her greatly.\n\nIf you choose this ending, Shadowheart will tell you off for denying her a chance to make a choice and she will no longer want to travel with you.\n\nWait - I'm sorry. We can fix this. I did what's best for us. Trust me. Go on then. Leave.\n\nEven if you tell her you can fix it, she will continue to leave the party.\n\nWe surrendered Nightsong to Balthazar, who took her away to Moonrise Towers. Enraged, Shadowheart turned on us.\n\nOther outcomes will be recorded should something happen to Shadowheart:\n\nShadowheart left our party and won't return. Shadowheart died. We won't be able to bring her back.\n\nHow to unlock The Chosen of Shar\n\nHalsin - after defeating the goblins.\n\nThe Chosen of Shar Rewards\n\nSpear of Night (obtained as an objective) Selune's blessing (Free Nightsong) Moonlight Glaive (Free Nightsong)\n\nThe Chosen of Shar Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nCompanion Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 A Familiar Face ♦ Balthazar's Experiment ♦ Daughter of Darkness ♦ Decide Minthara's Fate ♦ In Case of Death... ♦ Our fiery friend ♦ The Blade of Frontiers ♦ The Githyanki Warrior ♦ The Grand Duke ♦ The Hellion's Heart ♦ The High Harper ♦ The Pale Elf ♦ The Urge ♦ The Wizard of Waterdeep",
