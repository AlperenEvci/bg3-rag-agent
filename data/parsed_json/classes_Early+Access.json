  "content": "Early Access for Baldur's Gate 3 is a feature that allows early game purchasers to preview the game while still in development. Released on Steam, Stadia, and GOG on October 6, 2020, Early Access is meant to allow players to give feedback on the game before it is finished, and therefore players should expect to encounter bugs, unfinished portions, and a lack of balancing. Players can expect that their feedback will be carefully considered, and possibly incorporated into the final product, which is usually rather different than the one experienced during Early Access.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Early Access Quick Navigation\n\nClick to jump to a specific section of the page\n\nShould I Play Baldur's Gate 3 Early Access?\n\nIn terms of being able to play the game and experience its different aspects, Early Access will be enjoyable for you if you simply can't wait to experience a Dungeons & Dragons game in video game format. If you want to see how well the Tabletop Role-playing Game could be initially translated into a video game format, with all its facets like player progression, Class progression, combat, and actual roleplay choice in dialogues, then Early Access will be a good experience for you. As previously mentioned, however, don't expect a fully-working game that allows you to play non-stop comfortably. Early Access is there for players to have a taste of what the game could be while giving developers feedback in terms of what could be improved, and what could be added. Additionally, playing Early Access should mean that you are alright with being spoiled at the beginning of the game's story. All that being said, if you are the type to want to contribute towards being able to play an amazing game, or you simply want to scratch the D&D itch early on, then Early Access is for you.\n\nBG3 Early Access Impressions\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Early Access\n\nHow Big is BG3 Early Access Content?\n\nEarly Access for Baldur's Gate 3 is approximated to be twenty-five to thirty-five hours of content, filled with Quests, different Locations, and Act 1 of the game's story. Players are able to enjoy a full-fledged Character Creation System, a Real-time with Pause combat system, as well as multiple available playstyles in Classes and Subclasses. There are eight Races, most of which will have Subraces to choose from for your characters, which carry with them different Ability Score bonuses. Early Access content encompasses just the first Act of the game's story, and players can only gain up to five levels at a maximum. Players can choose from eleven Classes, and two Subclasses later on when they reach a certain level, with the exception of the Paladin and Cleric Classes which have three Subclasses each.\n\nCharacter Creation in BG3 Early Access\n\nFor Early Access, players will be able to create their characters with an already full-fledged Character Creation system. Players will be able to see a preview of their Abilities and Proficiencies on the left side of the screen, while customization choices are displayed on the right. Customization starts with Origins but players will find all the options greyed out for now, aside from the Custom option. Players will then be able to choose their character's Race from nine different Races, along with a Subrace. Afterward, players will be able to choose from eleven different Classes, as well as other customization options for that class, if any, including the Subclasses. Players will then be able to choose three Skills in which their character will be proficient, aside from the ones granted by previous customization choices like their character's Background, Subrace, or Subclass. Players will then be able to fully customize their character's Appearance in a full-blown customization system. Lastly, players will then be able to choose how they want to spread out their points into their character's Abilities. There will be twenty-seven points in total to distribute. There should already be a recommended spread by default in case the player has a hard time choosing.\n\nRaces and Subraces in BG3 Early Access\n\nSubraces: Lolth-Sworn Drow, Seldarine Drow\n\nSubraces: Gold Dwarf, Shield Dwarf\n\nSubraces: High Elf, Wood Elf\n\nSubraces: Deep Gnome, Forest Gnome, Rock Gnome\n\nSubraces: Drow Half-Elf, High Half-Elf, Wood Half-Elf\n\nSubraces: Lightfoot Halfling, Strongheart Halfling\n\nSubraces: Asmodeus Tiefling, Mephistopheles Tiefling, Zariel Tiefling\n\nClasses and Subclasses in BG3 Early Access\n\nThe strong embrace the wild that hides inside - keen instincts, primal physicality, and most of all, an unbridled, unquenchable rage.\n\nBerserker ♦ Wildheart\n\nYou know music is more than a fancy - it is power.

This is both in terms of graphics, to match the general improvements the developers have made from Early Access, and also in terms of its content. As listed above, the Dragonborn and Half-Orc Races will be officially added when the game launches, along with the Subraces in Dragonborn's case. A new Subrace will also be added for the Dwarf to represent their Underdark-dwelling cousins. An entire new Class, the Monk, will be added along with its Subclasses, as well as new Subclasses for the already-existing Classes for a staggering total number of forty-six Subclasses. Character's Ability Score bonuses will not anymore come with and depend on their Race, but on the chosen Class instead. The Appearance customization of Character Creation will also undergo a significant expansion, with players able to customize more parts of their character's Appearances, with tons of more options, and even the option to change their character's Genitals. Finally, the different Origins will finally be selectable, allowing players to experience the game as the characters who are only available as Companions during Early Access. The Origin options called The Dark Urge and Karlach will also be added which were not even in the options during Early Access.\n\nFor an in-depth guide to Character Creation for Baldur's Gate 3, visit our page here.\n\nFor an in-depth guide to Origins in Baldur's Gate 3, visit our page here.\n\nNew Content in Baldur's Gate 3 Full Game\n\nIn terms of actual gameplay content, Baldur's Gate 3 will be released with one hundred to one hundred and twenty hours of gameplay.

CEO Swen Vincke explained that some rules and systems don't translate well directly from tabletop to digital game, so Larian has worked to create an interpretation of 5th Edition rules that works well as a digital game but still feels true to D&D.\n\nWill there be Companions or allies who are not Origin characters?\n\nYes, you will be able to recruit mercenaries.\n\nWill Feats be included?\n\nYes, but not immediately in Early Access though.\n\nWill my characters from Early Access be carried over to the Official release?\n\nSorry but no, you will have to start a new adventure in the official release.\n\nWill Baldur's Gate 3 get modding support?\n\nYes, but not in Early Access.\n\nWhat's the difficulty setting of Early Access?\n\nThere will be only one difficulty in Early Access release, more will be added in later updates.\n\nWill there be a Dungeon Master mode in BG3?\n\nThe devs are working on it, but may not include it in Early Access.\n\nWill all 5e classes be available at launch? How many will be in EA?\n\nAll classes from 5e Player's Handbook will be included at launch. In Early Access, you can play as a Cleric, Fighter, Ranger, Rogue, Warlock, or Wizard.\n\nWill custom characters have Voice Acting?\n\nYes, you can choose a voice as part of character creation.\n\nHow will multiclassing work?\n\nMulticlassing is not going to be available in Early Access at launch, but the devs are planning to add it later.\n\nWill Reactions be included in the game? Like D&D 5e?\n\nWhile it's not going to be in EA immediately, the features and mechanics that allow a character to perform an action as a reaction will be added in the official launch.\n\nAre there classic magic items from the existing D&D source material?\n\nYes, there will be a mixture of magic items from published DnD materials and some homebrew items of similar complexity and power level.\n\nHow much of Baldur's Gate 3 can you play in early access?\n\nLarian says that the early access version of the game will contain about 20 hours of gameplay. About 80 combat encounters, 45,980 lines of dialogues, and 596 characters in BG3 EA.\n\nWhat's the Level cap in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, your characters can reach a maximum level of 10, however, you can only reach level 4 in early access.",
