This means that they don't lose any kind of progression by breaking the Oath while being a high-level character. Note that this does not include Subclass-specific Features and Spells from the other three Subclasses. You can reclaim your previous Oath at any time. Talk to the Oathbreaker Knight at the camp and tell him you want to restore your oath. He will ask you to pay 1,000 gold in order to restore it. Paladins benefit from Divine Smite for increased damage output. Be sure to setup your Reactions so that you can just melee attack, and use Divine Smite if you want. To do this, hit \"L\" on the keyboard and tick each level of Divine Smite \"On\" and to \"Ask\". This will allow you to use Divine Smite with other Weapon Actions, Opportunity Attacks, as well as Smite Spells. Using the Dueling fighting style maximizes damage while using a one-handed weapon and a shield. Duelling is particularly good if you are out of Spell Slots and cannot Divine Smite. Defence is also a great choice of Fighting Style since most Paladin damage comes from Divine Smite anyway. Oath of Vengeance subclass offers more versatility for making morally ambiguous decisions, while Oathbreaker allows the player to choose whatever decisions he or she wants, both good and evil. Multiclassing at level 2 or 6 are ideal for Paladin because at level 2 you can bring Divine Smite and all your Proficiencies to another Class, while at level 6 you gain Extra Attack and Aura of Protection, which are both fantastic. Paladins in BG3 use Charisma for Aura of Protection, and Dialogue mostly, but it does increase they number of Spells they can Prepare. There are very few hostile Paladin Spells that require high Charisma though, so don't pump Charisma thinking you will need it for these types of Spells unless you know which they are and you've planned ahead. You can completely dump Dexterity and use Heavy Armour for protection on your Paladin, and you won't gain the -1 penalty to AC at 8 DEX thanks to the way Heavy Armour works. Remember that Duelling doesn't work with Versatile Weapons, so using a Longsword is not ideal on a Paladin using this Fighting Style. Extra Attack only provides a second Attack if you used your Action to Attack to begin with. You cannot cast a spell and then attack, or attack and then cast a spell. And, Extra Attack doesn't stack with other Classes that have Extra Attack.\n\nAll Paladin Spells in Baldurs Gate 3\n\nYou can search by Name, Level, School and Casting Time.
