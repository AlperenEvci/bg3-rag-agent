Feats are special talents or expertises that provide special capabilities to characters. At certain levels, your character will get to choose between an Ability Score Improvement Feature or a Feat. (Note this feat is not available in EA and all info is subject to change.)\n\nCharger Information\n\nYou gain Charger: Weapon Attack and Charger: Shove. This allows you to reach a target that you normally wouldn't get to in a turn with just your movement because you can move your full distance and charge into the target a good distance away and deal more damage when you're doing it\n\nHow to unlock Charger\n\nYou'll need to fulfill the following requirements to unlock Charger\n\nAll Classes at Level 4\n\nCharger Tips & Notes\n\nThe push from this feat can also be used to push creatures that are too heavy for the default shove. Your push also scales with Strength/Athletics, and this feat makes it easier to push things or enemies around. The damage output is based on your Main Hand Weapon and doesn't factor in whether it's dual wield. There is definitely a case to be made for this, particularly if you are a melee character that has a hard time getting to the target that you're trying to reach When charging, you do not need a target to do so, and you don't have to end your charge in the melee range of your target in order to hit them. The action part of the cost can be any Attack action during your turn, which gives you extra attacks before or after a charge.
