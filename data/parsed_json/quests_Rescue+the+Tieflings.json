Rescue the Tieflings can be acquired during Act 2.

She's asked us to save them. Rolan's brother and sister were among the tiefling kidnapped by the ciltists. He hasn't taken it well.\n\nBreak the tieflings out of captivity.\n\nWe found the captured tieflings. They won't last long in Moonrise Towers. We should find a way to help them escape.\n\nSpeak to the gnomes.\n\nThe gnomes have a plan to break out of the prison. We should speak to them.\n\nProtect the gnomes.\n\nThe gnomes are on their way to free the tiefling captives. We need to protect them.\n\nAssist the tieflings' escape through the tunnels.\n\nThe tieflings escaped using a boat found in the tunnels of Moonrise Towers.\n\nRescue the Tieflings Walkthrough\n\nIf you saved the tieflings in Act 1, then once you arrive at the Last Light Inn in the Shadow-Cursed lands you will find that not all of them have made it. This quest will involve finding the captive tieflings being held in Moonrise Towers and helping them escape from the prison.\n\nThe Moonrise Towers are located in the Southwest corner of the Shadow-Curse Lands Region. You will likely need to complete the quest Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse in order to enter the region as without the buff from the item you receive during that quest you will have a very hard time reaching this area.\n\nWhen you reach the Towers, you will be stopped and forced into a dialogue with a True Soul guarding the front door. The True Soul will direct you to the main audience chamber as part of the Main Quest Infiltrate Moonrise Towers, but you can ignore this and go straight to the dungeons without talking to Ketheric Thorm. Look in a room to the west of the Audience Chamber with a blood-stain trail leading to a set of stairs. Take these stairs down to reach the Moonrise Towers Prison.\n\nHeading to the Moonrise Towers Prison\n\nIn order to find the Tieflings that were imprisoned in Moonrise Towers, you will find a stair leading to this area at (X:-175 Y:-193). Interact with the stairs here and this will take you to the Moonrise Towers Prison. If you still have a good relationship with the cultists or haven't started a fight with them, the guards will let you in without a fight. Make sure to explore each room here if you want to stock up on scrolls and elixirs. You will also find barrels and chests that you can open. As you head into the prison rooms, you will find a Scrying Eye guarding. With this sentinel, you have to make sure not to do anything suspicious while it watches in that area.\n\nYou will find the Tiefling Lia standing at the prison cell with who you can engage in a conversation, this however, will be put to a stop by one of the guards watching, forbidding you from speaking to them. You will be given 3 options to respond:\n\n[DECEPTION] I have permission from Balthazar. Ask him. [PERSUASION] What are the prisoners going to do? Talk me to death. My apologies- won't happen again.\n\nAttempting the Persuasion check will require you to pass a DC of 14. When successful, you can continue talking to Lia and she tells you that the gnomes are up to something and they're working together. Urging you to find these gnomes to talk to them. Continue to go around the cells and you will find Wulbren, who is curious about how you were able to order the guard successfully. He wants to know what is your business with them. You can offer to help him for free or for a fee or tell him that you want to torment him.\n\nIf you choose to help them for free, he will want to know the reason behind this. You can attempt the Persuasion check that will require you to pass a DC of 10. Your turn to respond:\n\nBarcus told me you were here, and asked me to help. [PERSUASION] I know the Tieflings imprisoned here- I want to break you all out. [PERSUASION] My mind is my own- the Absolute has no control over me. [DECEPTION] I'm an undercover agent for the Flaming Fist. Fine, die in here for all I care.\n\nWhen successful, Wulbren will tell you about his plan which involves looking for tools. He will ask for you to hand them anything that can break rocks and also make sure that no one will see you helping them. (Needs a blunt weapon like morningstar etc. Even a Salami will do) He also tells you that the Warden robbed them of their tools, and you can start looking from there. Locating the Tieflings and Wulbren will update the quests for these characters in your journal.\n\n(Give Wulbren some weapon you wont miss, like a Salami)\n\nYou will find the Warden in their room at (X:572 Y:-655), and ask her questions about confiscated items to reveal that she is hiding these in the office above. You may also attempt the Intelligence check which will require you to pass a DC of 13, this will reveal that levers behind her desk can open the doors of the cells, and the larger lever is used to trigger the alarm.\n\nWith her back turned against you, you can sneak to go up the ladder. However, there is a Scrying Eye in this area so it's not advisable to steal the tools under its watchful eyes. The moment you get spotted, she will confront you to explain yourself:\n\nAcquiesce and follow to prison. Try to talk your way out of it. Try to convince them you belong here. Perhaps some gold would make up for my little indiscretion? (1238) Try to buy your way in. (4952) Attack.\n\nChoosing the second option will you further choices which requires you to pass a DC of 15:\n\n[DECEPTION] Would you look at that- my map's upside down. I should have turned right at that crossroads. [INTIMIDATION] Let me be, or you won't live to regret it. [PERSUASION] Haven't you ever been turned around on your way to a date with destiny?\n\nAnother option is to fight The Warden since this area is unseen from the level above. Make sure to destroy the Scrying Eye in this area so that the others will not be alerted. After this, you can now search the office where items are being stored. Make sure to loot the Warden's body to retrieve the Spellcrux Amulet and the Moonrise Guard's Key from her.\n\nThe chests above are locked but you can unlock them by doing a Dexterity check which requires you to pass a DC of 14-16, which varies on the difficulty of the chests. With The Warden gone, you can free the tieflings and Wulbreg by interacting with the levers behind the desk. However, there are still guards nearby so this will commence a battle between them and your party. It is best to take care of the nearby guards before handing them the tools so that they can escape through the tunnels.\n\nFollow them through the tunnels by using the walls that they have broken through. You will find a boat docked at (X:572 Y:-577) and their party will take their leave. This will complete your quests Rescue Wulbren and Rescue the Tieflings.\n\nNow that the prisoners have escaped Moonrise Towers Prison, you will be able to complete both Rescue the Tieflings and Rescue Wulbren here.\n\nHow to unlock Rescue the Tieflings\n\nRescue the Tieflings can be unlocked by speaking to Alfira or Rolan in the Last Light Inn in the Shadow-Cursed Lands\n\nRescue the Tieflings Rewards\n\nPotent Robe, Scroll of Globe of Invunlerability, Scroll of Dominate Person, Scroll of Wall of Fire, Diluted Oil of Sharpness, Two Potions of Greater Healing, Alchemist's Fire, Grease Bottle, and 280 experience.\n\nRescue the Tieflings Notes & Tips\n\nWhen rescuing Rolan, keep in mind that you can throw potions at allies to heal them, and this works on Rolan as well. You may be able to give him more restored hit points in a single round if you have a martial class like a Fighter, Barbarian, or Ranger in your party who can attack multiple times (and therefore can throw multiple potions in one turn if needed) Inside the prison, the jailer's room have 6 levers, one for each room and a bigger one which is the alarm. if you open the jails, the NPCs will escape through the main entrance, triggering a lot of fights. Opening them is recommended only after they broke through the weakened stone wall and went to the escape boat. One of the cells (number 4) contains a green-hued hole that leads to a level below, giving you an answer about the tadpoles and weird flesh noises inside the tower. When escorting them on the boat, the quest will be completed for both Rescue the Tieflings and Rescue Wulbren.\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
