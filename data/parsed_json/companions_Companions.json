  "content": "Companions in Baldur's Gate 3 are characters that can be recruited to join the player's party and fight alongside them in combat. Each companion have different traits, equipment, lore, skills, and more — making them unique from one another. Throughout the game, players will meet NPCs that can be recruited as companions once certain conditions have been met. This page covers a list of all the Companions found in Baldur's Gate 3. Some Companions can be chosen by the player during Character Creation — a feature known as Origins, allowing the player to control these characters and play from their point of view.\n\nAll Companions, including both Origins and Hirelings, can be respecced in the game to any other class, the only thing that can't be changed is Race (and Sub-race for 2 characters). If a character like Wyll is changed into a different class, the character will still be, story-wise a Warlock in their head. so absolutely nothing is changed for their story, origin, or lore if they are respecced in any way to any other class in the game.\n\nNote: If you chose Lae'zel as your origin, you will meet a temporary Githyanki companion named Losiir in the prologue. (Who is later killed in the crash, there's no way to acquire his tadpole.)\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Companion Tips\n\nBG3 Companion Selection Helpful Notes\n\nConsider your own main character's class when choosing companions. Choose companions who fulfill different roles to create a well-rounded party. Assign roles to companions based on their classes: combat specialist, dialogue specialist, utility, support caster, and offensive caster. Karlach and Lae'zel are combat specialists; avoid having both in the same party. Shadowheart is the primary utility and support character among the early companions. Gale serves as the offensive caster among the initial companions. Respec companions early in the game to optimize their ability scores and skills.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 List of all Companions with guide\n\nAstarion is a High Elf Rogue who has prowled the night as a vampire spawn for centuries, serving a sadistic master until he was snatched away.

Although Hirelings are not as interactive as Origins or Companions, they each feature a unique identity and backstory.\n\nOnce Withers has joined your Camp, you may speak to him to recruit a Hireling for 100 gold. There are 12 Hirelings on the roster available for recruitment, one from each class.\n\nYou may have up to three Hirelings recruited to your party and Camp at a time. Unlike Companions, you may dismiss Hirelings from your service at any time. Their level will be reverted to 1, and their inventory will be transferred to yours.\n\nDo I need Hirelings in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nNot necessarily, but you can use them to fill up your party or to replace any lost companion from your team. Hirelings can also be hired to cast buffs on your main parties. You can also create a completely customized party with just Hirelings. If a Companion should permanently leave your party, you can replace them with Hirelings. The possibilities are endless as you can even hire a combination of Hirelings with the same class. You can have a party entirely made of Barbarian for example. Hirelings also give you additional options beyond the characters available from the Origins roster and it also gives you full control of the strengths and weaknesses of the Classes in your party.\n\nRespec a Character and Recruiting Hirelings in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, you can Respec your characters as many times as you want, as long as you have the required gold and have already added Withers to the Camp. Approach him and select Respec among the services he provides. Withers will ask for 100 gold pieces for his service. The price of the service DOES NOT increase. Withers also is the person you need to talk to be able to access Hirelings.\n\nAny character can interact with Withers to Respec, even your Companions if they pay the asking price. Note that respeccing a character does not change its dialogue interactions or Quests.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3: Selecting your Hireling\n\nWhen you're about to recruit Hirelings, you will be able to choose from a selection of 12 Hirelings, with each one representing a different Class. By recruiting Hirelings to your party, you can tailor the group dynamic to focus on a specific class, allowing you to create a customized composition that would synergize well with your preferred party build. With that being said, it is entirely possible for you to have a party made up of only Fighters for example. You may respec them at any time to create a customized party.",
