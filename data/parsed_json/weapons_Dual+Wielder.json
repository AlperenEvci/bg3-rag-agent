Great for characters that are dual wielding in Heavy armor or Medium armor and already have their Dex AC bonus capped. A requirement for dual wielding characters who want to make use of unique/magical Longswords or Rapiers. If you're a STR character and you're wearing heavy armor and all your points are in Strength, and Dexterity isn't going to give you any extra armor, then this might be a good choice for you. This is also a great choice for you if you want to dual wield Longswords or Rapiers, as 2d8 worth of weapon damage is 1 additional damage over just getting +2 Dexterity or Strength. If you're a DEX character and you're dual wielding, you might want to take Dexterity here to gain the same plus one Armor Class (if not using medium/heavy armor) and plus one damage, but additionally gain plus one Attack and plus one to all Dexterity skills. However, dual wielding non-light weapons allows Finesse characters to dual wield Rapiers (2d8) which do more damage, especially for those without the dual wielding fighting style.Dual Wielding Longswords or Rapiers is also extremely cool and you should always remember to put the theme and roleplay of your character over min/maxing. Thieves (or anyone with additional bonus actions) will do an additional +1 damage using Rapier in the offhand with each attack, for a total of 2 more damage using this feat compared to the +2 Dexterity choice if they do not have the dual wielding fighting style. Remember, you do not get to add your Dexterity bonus to damage unless you have the dual wielding fighting style. This feat can help a Thief without the dual wielding fighting style get +2 additional damage when attacking with both bonus actions, over denying this Feat to get +2 Dexterity. Works with all forms of Wild Shape.\n\nAll Feats in Baldur's Gate 3 Ability Improvements ♦ Actor ♦ Alert ♦ Athlete ♦ Charger ♦ Crossbow Expert ♦ Defensive Duellist ♦ Dungeon Delver ♦ Durable ♦ Elemental Adept ♦ Great Weapon Master ♦ Heavily Armoured ♦ Heavy Armour Master ♦ Lightly Armoured ♦ Lucky (Feat) ♦ Mage Slayer ♦ Magic Initiate: Bard ♦ Magic Initiate: Cleric ♦ Magic Initiate: Druid ♦ Magic Initiate: Sorcerer ♦ Magic Initiate: Warlock ♦ Magic Initiate: Wizard ♦ Martial Adept ♦ Medium Armour Master ♦ Mobile ♦ Moderately Armoured ♦ Observant ♦ Performer ♦ Polearm Master ♦ Resilient ♦ Ritual Caster ♦ Savage Attacker ♦ Sentinel ♦ Sharpshooter ♦ Shield Master ♦ Skilled ♦ Spell Sniper ♦ Tavern Brawler ♦ Tough ♦ Unstable Blood ♦ War Caster ♦ Weapon Master",
