But if you're a Necromancy Wizard you gain the ability to target two corpses at level 6. Wizards with the Necromancy School subclass can raise an additional undead for each level and version of the spell. These Summoned Undead do not have weapons so are not affected by Aura of Hate from Oathbreaker Paladin Most friendly and neutral NPCs will respond to undead minions with horror, causing them to express alarm and flee from proximity of the thralls, in some cases to their death.\n\nLvl 3 Spells Beacon of Hope ♦ Bestow curse ♦ Blinding Smite ♦ Blink ♦ Call Lightning ♦ Celestial Haste ♦ Conjure Barrage ♦ Counterspell ♦ Crusader's Mantle ♦ Daylight ♦ Elemental Weapon ♦ Fear ♦ Feign Death ♦ Fireball ♦ Fly ♦ Gaseous Form ♦ Glyph of Warding ♦ Grant Flight ♦ Haste ♦ Hunger of Hadar ♦ Hypnotic Pattern ♦ Lightning Arrow ♦ Lightning Bolt ♦ Mass Healing Word ♦ Paralyzing Ray ♦ Plant Growth ♦ Protection from Energy ♦ Remove Curse ♦ Revivify ♦ Scorching Ray Shot ♦ Sleet Storm ♦ Slow ♦ Speak with Dead ♦ Spirit Guardians ♦ Stinking Cloud ♦ Summon Quothe the Raven ♦ Vampiric Touch",
