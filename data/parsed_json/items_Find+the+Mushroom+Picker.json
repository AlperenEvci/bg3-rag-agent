Find the Mushroom Picker can be acquired during Act 1. Completing Find the Mushroom Picker will progress the story forward.\n\nFind the Mushroom Picker Objectives\n\nSave the dwarf Speak with Derryth\n\nFind the Mushroom Picker Walkthrough\n\nThere's a dwarf trapped in the northwest corner of Underdark, surrounded by Bibberbang. These plants exhale poisons and explode when they sense vibrations. (You can give him Misty Step scroll to save him.) When you enter the line of sight of the dwarf he will open a dialog to explain the danger. You may then show a Misty Step scroll if your party has one. If you are near the dwarf, you can hand it to him. If you are farther away, you can pass a strength roll (10) to throw it successfully to him. This will save him. Turn-based mode in concert with Dash is an easy solution for navigating this area, because you can run right past the mushrooms without triggering them, and as long as you end each turn far enough away from the mushrooms, you won't set them off. There is also a series of elevated cliffs on the left side that can be used to get past most (but not all) of the mushrooms There's a noblestalk plant on the right side. If you trigger the Bibberbangs however, it will be destroyed. The dwarf requests that you get his backpack to him (or, you can give him a misty step scroll, and get the backpack later). The backpack contains a spell to make his escape easy. (You can use Mage Hand to get it, which won't trigger the Bibberbang) Once you saved the dwarf, he tells you that he must hurry and then leaves.\n\nYou can get the Noblestalk in the back right corner (quest item) and:\n\nKeep for yourself (Dark Urge origin can learn more about his/her past.) Give it to Derryth and she will keep it and welcome you at her shop at Baldur's Gate. She also gives Gloves of Uninhibited Kushigo (1d4 damage with Throw Attacks) Karlach (follower) is Inspired Give it to Baelen, he regains his memory. His speech is clear but authoritative- it's clear he thinks he's Derryth's superior. Derryth gets very nervous, telling herself that \"It's going to be ok\", and asking the adventurer \"What did you do?\". She refuses any attempts to help her leave Baelen. Give it to Shadowheart to unlock some of her repressed memories.\n\nYou can extort Derryth for an additional reward for the Noblestalk through an intimidation check even though she says she has nothing to give. She awards you a non-magic wedding ring that sells for about 115gp and then seems to not like you afterward. You also have the option to keep both the ring and the Noblestalk.\n\nHow to unlock Find the Mushroom Picker\n\nDerryth Northwest area of Underdark\n\nFind the Mushroom Picker Rewards\n\nFind the Mushroom Picker Notes & Tips\n\nAn easy way to reach the backpack is to use the spell Misty Step to teleport to it. After that right click the backpack and throw it to the dwarf, being careful not to damage him. A strong character like Lae'zel can jump from safe spot to safe spot and reach both the backpack and Baelen without triggering the Bibberbang mushrooms. An imp (summoned by Wyll) can move the backpack and the torch that will set the poison fumes alight without triggering the Bibberbang mushrooms. The backpack contains several items beside two scrolls of Misty Step, so it pays to empy the backpack and then provide Baelen with a scroll of Misty Step - or just throw him a scroll the first time he speaks with you, and get the backpack for yourself. The Sovereign Glut can be used to navigate through the area to move both the Noblestalk and the backpack - you can then take the Misty Step scroll out of the backpack and move it back to Baelen without triggering the Bibberbang mushrooms. He will use it automatically when it is near him. As you walk across the branch to enter the Bibberbang field, look west right after crossing the branch/enter the field. There's a series of rocks to the west (-27,-81) that you can jump onto. Leads to a skeleton you can loot that has Explorer's Ring (+1 Nature, +1 Survival).\n\nQuests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
