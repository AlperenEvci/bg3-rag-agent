Avenge Glut's Circle can be acquired during Chapter 1 which involves helping the Myconid Colony of Glut. During Early Access, this quest was named 'Avenge the Sovereign' but was changed to full launch on August 3, 2023. This page will cover all information about the quest including location, walkthrough, objectives, rewards, and more.\n\nAvenge Glut's Circle Objectives\n\nSpeak with Glut Kill the Duergar\n\nHow to unlock Avenge Glut's Circle\n\nMyconid Colony, Glut\n\nAvenge Glut's Circle Rewards\n\nFeatherlight Boots Winter's Clutches\n\nAvenge Glut's Circle Walkthrough\n\nAs you are exploring Ebonlake Grotto, you will meet the rest of the members of the Myconid Colony. Look for Glut nearby who will ask you to tell him of home. You will get the following options in the picture below:\n\nGlut is a sovereign without a circle and he wishes to claim his power back. If you choose the second option, Glut will respond with its own picture of his own home. He will continue to tell you that duergar destroyed his people, and left without a circle. He wishes to join you to help cleans the Duergar rot. He offers to raise the dead and you will have command of it. You can respond with one of the options below:\n\nAre you sure? It's going to be dangerous. Join me? That depends- can you make yourself useful? Very well- you may join me. I don't need your help. I'm not traveling with some overgrown mushroom. Leave.\n\nIf you accept his help, then you will be given a new quest which is Avenge Glut's Circle. After agreeing to help Sovereign Glut, you will now go to seek the Duergar threatening the peace of the Myconid Colony.\n\nIn the Decrepit Village at (X:15 Y:-179) a Duergar will spot you and take you to Gekh Coal who is ready to fight after you get caught sneaking. Attempting the Persuasion (Charisma) will require you to pass a DC check of 15.\n\nI could've killed you before you even noticed me, but didn't. Stand down. [INTIMIDATION] Take your hand off that axe before you lose it. [PERSUASION] I can be discreet. No need for bloodshed. Attack him. Turn to leave.\n\nIf your attempt is successful he will let you live. He shares that a certain slave ran away and took Sergeant Thrinn's boots, which describes the same situation as Thulla did before. You can decide if you want to give the boots and tell him that you have it, or do it at a later time, or simply attack him here. If you have decided on how to proceed with this, make sure to walk towards (X:23 Y:-211) to discover a waypoint before moving on to the next interaction.\n\nFollowing this walkthrough, we will keep our word to Sovereign Glut and Thulla. You can now return to the Myconid Colony and inform Glut that the Duergar has been taken care of. He demands to see the bodies, and you can walk back to the area to show him. However, as soon as Glut sees the body he's dissatisfied and wishes to take Spaw's circle. Glut is blinded by his hunger for power and wishes to devour the colony whole. If you take Glut's side you will need to return to the colony and kill everyone including Spaw. Alternatively, you can also take Glut to Spaw and talk to the ruler of the Myconid Circle. You can then choose to announce that you will depose Spaw in favor of Glut. Then if you kill only Spaw without hurting anyone else, Glut take control of the colony and you don't have to kill anyone else. If you take Glut's side you will receive Featherlight Boots and Winter's Clutches as rewards.\n\nAvenge Glut's Circle Notes & Tips\n\nYou can use Glut to resurrect the Minotaurs, they carry Greatclub. You can use Glut to resurrect the Bulette. Note that if you choose to remain loyal to Spaw instead of Glut, his summoned minion will also attack you. Avoid this by desummoning any powerful minion before combat by reanimating a weaker enemy after the Duergar fight but before speaking with Glut again. Glut gains the Frenzied Spores condition after agreeing to kill Spaw. \"Glut has increased hit points and Strength. It has access to more spore spells\" It is possible to get the reward from Spaw for killing the Duergar before killing Spaw for Glut.\n\nQuests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
