Shadowheart will remember an old friend and this quest only has one objective: Find Shadowheart's old friend.\n\nThis quest can also be triggered in Act 1 if you successfully persuade Shadowheart to consume the Noblestalk.

Before selecting one of the options to convince her, it is necessary to switch to a different party member, then open the party menu, and move the Noblestalk from the inventory of the player character into the inventory of another party member. Finally, the Noblestalk must be dropped on the ground. After returning to the dialogue with Shadowheart, she must be convinced to eat the nobelstalk as usual. The cutscene will still trigger, but the Noblestalk will remain on the ground without disappearing.\n\nFind Shadowheart's old friend.\n\nThe quest is activated in the Lower City.
