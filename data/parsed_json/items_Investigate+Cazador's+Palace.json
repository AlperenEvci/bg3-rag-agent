Investigate Cazador's Palace can be acquired during Act 3. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earning more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nInvestigate Cazador's Palace Objectives\n\nFind the Szarr Palace\n\nWe met a tribe of Gur people. Their leader Ulma, told us that a vampire called Cazador has been killing their people and kidnapping their children. She asked us to save the children and slay the vampire. We should find where Cazador resides.\n\nInvestigate Cazador's Palace Walkthrough\n\nContinuing north to Gur Camp (X:93 Y:-18), you witness an ongoing mini ceremony. These individuals are a tribe of Monster Hunters, similar to the ones encountered in Hag's Swamp. Ulma halts the ceremony to approach you. She discloses her search for Astarion and initiates a conversation:\n\nWhat's your interest in Astarion? If you're looking to burn him on the pyre, I'm in favor. We're not interested in your affairs.\n\nChoose the first option, and Ulma explains that Astarion took their children during his last visit. However, she notes that circumstances have changed: Astarion severed ties with his master and the binding spell. Astarion adds his perspective, and you can reply:\n\nYes, Astarion is free now. It was luck more than skill. Why do you care about this matter?\n\nOpt for the second choice, and Ulma acknowledges their misfortune. Despite their efforts to rescue the children from Cazador Szarr's well-guarded palace, they've been unsuccessful. Ulma speculates that if one of his offspring approached, he might believe he could control Astarion, thus allowing his entry. Astarion disputes this, knowing Cazador's merciless nature. He's convinced the children are deceased. You can interject with:\n\nWe'll do our best to save them. You might be right, but it's worth trying. How can you be so certain, Astarion?\n\nSelect the third option, prompting Astarion to explain his history of offering victims to his master over the past two centuries, resulting in their consumption on the same night. Ulma persists, urging you to rescue them or seek vengeance. Respond with:\n\nIf Astarion won't assist, I will. Astarion owes them revenge at the very least. There's nothing more to discuss if we can't help.\n\nChoose the second option, leading Astarion to agree. This update progresses the quest \"A Pale Elf.\" and \"Investigate Casador's Palace\".\n\nUpon arriving at Wyrm's Crossing, X:-13 Y:58, proceed to Fraygo's Flophouse, X:-16 Y:76, where a cutscene unfolds featuring Dalyria and Pale Petras engaged in a dispute about securing more marks for their master during the Black Mass. Pale Petras reveals that the other mark is designated for himself, granting him freedom after the Master's approval. Suddenly, Astarion intervenes, his sarcasm evident as he questions if Cazador truly promised them freedom and whether they believed such a pledge. Dalyria expresses astonishment at Astarion's return, given his previous freedom. You have the option to step in with:\n\nOur objective is to eliminate Cazador. Only then can you gain your freedom. Provide us with information about the ritual. What do you know? Hold your tongue.\n\nOpt for the second choice, and Pale Petras assumes that Astarion's return indicates his desire to ascend alongside them. Astarion's anger flares at Petras, and he curses at him. He seizes Petras, issuing threats. Dalyria pleads with Astarion to stop. You can respond with:\n\nSpeak or suffer the flames. The choice is yours. Say nothing. [Persuasion] Astarion, Stop!\n\nChoose the first option, and Dalyria discloses that the Master is preparing the Black Mass in a tainted chapel beneath his palace. Astarion releases Petras, resolving to thwart Cazador. Petras expresses astonishment, questioning Astarion's transformation. Astarion cryptically states that he has evolved beyond his former self, unafraid of anything. The sun's constraints and Cazador's influence no longer bind him. He asserts his unique capability to confront Cazador. Astarion instructs them to leave, and they vanish abruptly. Respond to Astarion with:\n\nI commend your compassion for sparing them. They might alert Cazador to our approach. We should have eliminated them.\n\nUpon selecting the second option, Astarion concurs, acknowledging their likely warning and resultant trepidation. He empathizes with their coerced compliance under Cazador's will. He references Seven Sigils held by seven spawns, with Cazador in possession of six. Confronting him becomes imperative to seize the power. Your response can be:\n\nSacrificing your siblings? Are you willing? Why not maintain distance? Cazador's ritual hinges on finding you. 'Ourselves'? Perhaps you mean yourself. At times, your intimidation surpasses the elder brain's. Let's proceed.\n\nOpt for the third choice, and Astarion concurs. He asserts that by augmenting his power, the entire team benefits. He queries if you remain steadfast. Respond:\n\nWe're a team. I've got your back. What if this is a trap? I'm uncertain. Shall we go? We've obtained what's needed – the ritual's location beneath the palace.\n\nChoosing the second option prompts Astarion to assert that collectively, you will address the situation.\n\nWhile exploring Fraygo's Flophouse you can overhear 2 vampires discussing a party in Cazador's Palace. The leader of the Tribe of Gur asks you to save their children in Cazador's Palace. The entrance to the Szarr Palace South Tower locates near the Lower City waypoint. (X:-68; Y:-53.) In order to open the Sinister Door in Cazador's Palace, you need to find Kozakuran Dictionary in a necrotic room and Szarr Family Ring on Godey. Both are on the 1st floor of the palace.(Kozakuran Dictionary in a Wardrobe on the 1st floor of the palace.)(Szarr Family Ring can be found on Godey) In Cazador's dungeon, you can find the skull of his master, the ancient vampire Velioth. Succeed in 3 Wisdom checks to learn about Cazador's Ritual. There's a Pelorsun Blade on the lower level of the dungeon. Astarion's former master has Sunlight Hypersensitivity, spells like Sunburst deals 20 radiant damage each turn if he starts his turn in sunlight. He also has a disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks while under the sun's glare. Several thralls are entrapped via magical runes. Cazador's HP and necrotic damage are buffed while he's feeding on them. Once you drafted Cazador, you need to decide whether or not to let Astarion complete the ritual. If the ritual is complete, Astarion will become a Vampire Ascendant, gaining the Ascendant Bite and Gaseous Form abilities, as well as bonus 1-10 necrotic damage for his attacks. When you leave the area, the Gur Tribe, a group of monster hunters, will accost you. If you let Astarion finished the ritual, they will believe he is a monster and attack. If not, they will let you leave peacefully, and joins you as allies in quest Gather Your Allies.\n\nHow to unlock Investigate Cazador's Palace\n\nYou can acquire this quest from the Tribe of Gur.\n\nInvestigate Cazador's Palace Rewards\n\nInvestigate Cazador's Palace Notes & Tips\n\nAstarion can show up here if you kill him in the early parts of the story\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
