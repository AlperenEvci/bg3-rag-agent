  "content": "Merchants for Baldur's Gate 3 are various NPCs that players may find as the story progresses. Players will be able to buy certain items and as well as trading a variety of goods and resources that have been gathered or are no longer needed for a certain amount of gold. You can find detailed information on a merchant's location and more on each individual page linked below.\n\nMerchant Inventory Resets\n\nMany Merchants in Baldur's Gate 3 have a partially randomized selection of items on sale from their overall item pool. This primarily applies to Scrolls, Potions, Food, and Weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus. Merchants will reset their inventory if the player either levels up (the reset occurs when the player completes their level up, rather than on receiving sufficient experience) or if the player completes a Long Rest.\n\nResetting a Merchant's inventory will generate a new selection of items from their overall item pool, as well as restocking any non-randomized items the player has purchased. Certain items, generally those with unique names, are not restocked upon either levelling up or completing a Long Rest.\n\nMerchant selling and buying prices\n\nMerchants will not buy or sell items at their listed value, instead, the prices offered by Merchants will vary based on both the currently selected character's Charisma and the Attitude of the Merchant towards the currently selected character. By default (with 10 Charisma and 0 Attitude) Merchants will sell items to the player for 250% of their real value, and buy items from the player for 40% of their real value.\n\nThese prices will be changed if the currently selected character has higher or lower Charisma or Attitude.\n\nA Merchant's Attitude can be increased by completing a trade with them that is unbalanced in their favour. You can also gift items and gold to the merchant, without asking their items or gold in return. The increase in attitude you get with the trade depends on the gold value the merchant \"profited\" and the character's level. The higher the character's level, the more gold you need to give to shift their attitude. At 1st level, each 4 gp in the merchan't favor increases their attitude by 1.\n\nThe most optimized way to max out the merchant's attitude is to, first, pay 100 gp to reset the character to level 1, then gift 400 gp to the merchant as a level 1 characeter.\n\nA Merchant's Attitude can be decreased by doing the opposite; trying to complete a trade with them that is unbalanced in your favour. This will initially have no effect but after you try for a third time, will start to decrease their Attitude by 15 each time.\n\nNote: Each merchant has a different attitude level toward each character. Only the Attitude and Persuasion of the character that initiated the trade is taken into consideration, even if you change character in the trade interface.\n\nMerchant Selling Price\n\nThe price at which a Merchant sells items to the player changes linearly based on both factors:\n\nCharisma Modifier: Each +1, or -1, change to the player's charisma modifier will decrease, or increase, the Merchant's selling price by 10% respectively. Attitude: 1 point of positive, or negative, attitude towards the player will decrease, or increase, the Merchant's selling price by 0.5% respectively. Positive attitude with NPCs is capped at +100, while negative attitude with friendly NPCs is capped at -45.\n\nThis information is shown in the following table:\n\nMerchant Sell Prices -45 Attitude 0 Attitude 25 Attitude 50 Attitude 75 Attitude 100 Attitude -2 Modifier 292.5% 270% 257.5% 245% 235.5% 220% -1 Modifier 282.5% 260% 247.5% 235% 225.5% 210% 0 Modifier 272.5% 250% 237.5% 225% 212.5% 200% +1 Modifier 262.5% 240% 227.5% 215% 202.5% 190% +2 Modifier 252.5% 230% 217.5% 205% 192.5% 180% +3 Modifier 242.5% 220% 207.5% 195% 182.5% 170% +4 Modifier 232.5% 210% 197.5% 185% 172.5% 160%\n\nMerchant Buying Price\n\nThe price at which a Merchant will buy items from a player also changes based on the selected character's Persuasion skill value (that is, Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus, if proficient) and the Merchant's Attitude towards that character. If the character's Persuasion skill and the merchant's Attitude toward the character are both zero, the value the merchant pays on the item equals the item's base value divided by 3. Each point of Persuasion and each 20 points of Attitude reduce this divider by 0.1. Thus, the formula is:\n\nMerchant Buying Price = Item Base Value / ( 3 - Persuasion * 0.1 - Attitude * 0.005 )\n\nNote: The value is rounded to the closest whole number.\n\nPersuasion skill (plus 1 for every 20 Attitude) Base Price Multiplier Example (1,000 gp item) 0 0.3333333333 (33.33%) 332 1 0.3448275862 (34.48%) 345 2 0.3571428571 (35.71%) 357 3 0.3703703704 (37.04%) 370 4 0.3846153846 (38.46%) 385 5 0.4 (40.00%) 400 6 0.4166666667 (41.67%) 417 7 0.4347826087 (43.48%) 435 8 0.4545454545 (45.45%) 454 9 0.4761904762 (47.62%) 476 10 0.5 (50.00%) 500\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Merchants\n\nCollector of valuable items at Druid Grove.\n\nA trader at Druid Grove.\n\nA Trader at Druid Grove.\n\nA Trader at ZHENTARIM HIDEOUT.\n\nA goblin trader at Goblin Camp.\n\nA Halfling merchant at Shattered Sanctum.\n\nA Trader at Underdark, Myconid Colony.\n\nA Trader at Grymforge.\n\nA Trader at Grymforge.\n\nA Trader at Underdark, Myconid Colony.\n\nA Drow Merchant at Moonrise Towers.\n\nA Society of Brilliance member at Rosymorn Monastery Trail.\n\nA Githyanki quartermistress in Cr√®che Y'llek.\n\nA trader at Last Light Inn.\n\nQuartermaster Talli\n\nA Harper trader at Last Light Inn.\n\nA Halfling merchant at Moonrise Towers.\n\nA trader at at Moonrise Towers.\n\nA trader at House of Healing.\n\nA human child merchant at the Guildhall\n\nA Dragonborn trader in Rivington General.\n\nA diabolist trader who resides at the Devil's Fee.\n\nA silent trader in the Undercity Ruins.\n\nLorroakan's Projection (Or Rolan)\n\nA trader in Sorcerous Sundries.\n\nA rat trader in flaming fist prison, Lower City.\n\nTolna Tome-Monger\n\nA trader sells scrolls and books in Sorcerous Sundries.\n\nGloomy Fentonson\n\nAn armour trader at the Stormshore Armoury, Lower City.\n\nFytz the Firecracker\n\nA weapons trader at the Stormshore Armoury, Lower City.\n\nVicar Humbletoes\n\nA trader in Stormshore Tabernacle.\n\nOwner of Danthelon's Dancing Axe in Wyrm's Crossing\n\nA Drow Merchant in the Lower City.",
