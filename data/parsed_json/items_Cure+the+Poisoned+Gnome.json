She has been wounded by a Duergar Poison. You can save her if you have an Antitoxin, the Duergar antidote from Ghekh, or if you succeed at using your knowledge about Duergar Poison. You can also attempt to steal her the Boots of Speed while she is under the effects of the poison. As a reward, she will give you her Boots of Speed. As she is in a condition that cannot help anyone, she asks for your help instead. She tells you that her clan, the Ironhand has been taken by the Duergar to dig an old ruin across the lake.
