  "content": "Save Hope Type Quest Act Act 3 Location Baldur's Gate Reward Gloves of Soul Catching\n\nSave Hope is a Quest in Baldur's Gate 3. Save Hope can be acquired during Act 3. This quest can be obtained when you reach Baldur's Gate. All Baldur's Gate quests will be grouped together in your quest journal. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earn more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nSave Hope Objectives\n\nFind the way to save Hope.\n\nWe met a strange spirit imprisoned in Raphael's home - named Hope, oddly enough. She mentioned an important hammer before disappearing abruptly. We should keep searching the House of Hope.\n\nSave Hope Walkthrough\n\nFind Heisik in Devil's Fee, give her the money, or persuade her to hand you the ritual to open the portal to the House of Hope. (Alternatively, you can steal the ingredients and sneak into the 2nd floor by yourself.) (How to open the portal to House of Hope) When you reached the House of Hope, you need to find the Orphic Hammer in Archive. (There is another side quest in this area, Save Hope) There's an Inert Infernal Gem on a wall. Pass the DC10 Wisdom and DC20 Intelligence checks to reveal a hidden Door. Inside, you'll find the Helldusk Helmet (very rare), and Staff of Spellpower (very rare). You'll also spot Mol's Contract and Tav's Contract if you accept Raphael's offer. Upon reaching the western portion of the House of Hope, use the hatch to enter the dungeon. Hope will tell you about the Archivist. Pass the skill checks here to learn that the Archivist is afraid of Zariel's inquisitor, Verillius Receptor. This gives you a dialogue option to pretend as the inquisitor, which means the Archivist won't bother you. Talk to the Archivist to get an invitation to enter the Boudoir. You can now pass through the Mystic Force Curtain. The pool inside can reinvigorate the team (work as long rest). You can let Haarlep take your body as a disguise, or simply fight him to take the key. Open the safe behind a painting to the left of the bed with the key to find the words that you need to get Orphic Hammer. Once you get the Hammer, the devils in House of Hope turn hostile. (Be careful when enemies die, they burst into flame. You can use the pool in Boudoir to reinvigorate your team. ) Run to Hope's dungeon to free her with the hammer. When you reach the entrance chamber, make your team combat-ready to face Rapheal. You can pass a DC30 Persuasion check, to convince Yugir to betray Raphael and fights with you (Yugir is also a potential ally in Gather your Allies). Rapheal has 666 HP and is enhanced by the Soul Pillars. However, he has very low WIS so OTTO'S IRRESISTIBLE DANCE, Hold Monsters and Tasha's Hideous Laughter work great. Raphael turns into his devil form when he's 60% HP or lower, granting him more melee attacks. Defeat Rapheal rewards Gloves of Soul Catching and Helldusk Armour.\n\n(How to open the portal to House of Hope)\n\nHow to unlock Save Hope\n\nEnter the House of Hope\n\nSave Hope Rewards\n\nGloves of Soul Catching (If Raphael is defeated.)\n\nSave Hope Notes & Tips\n\nPrepare a fight with Raphael, It is recommended that you prepare two Divine Interventions: Sunder the Heretical during the battle, with the first one cast from your party member, and the second cast from Hope herself.\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
