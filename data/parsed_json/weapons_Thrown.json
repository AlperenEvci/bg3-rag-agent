DaggersHandaxesJavelinsLight HammersSpearsTridents\n\nThrown is a Weapon Property in Baldur's Gate 3. Thrown is a weapon property that allows a weapon to be used as a projectile with the Throw or Enraged Throw actions. When throwing, these Weapons deal the same damage they would for a melee attack. Weapon Properties grant different weapon types, diverse features that are intrinsic to that specific weapon type.\n\nThrown Information\n\nA melee weapon with this property can be thrown for a ranged attack, and will benefit from the creature's Ability Score Modifier (Strength) and Proficiency Bonus as usual, instead of being treated as an Improvised Weapon. This combines with the Finesse property: if you throw a Dagger, which has both Thrown and Finesse, you can use your Dexterity Modifier for the attack and damage rolls.\n\nWeapon types that have Thrown\n\nDaggers Handaxes Javelins Light Hammers Spears Tridents\n\nThrown Notes & Tips\n\nNotes and tips go here\n\nAll Weapon Properties in Baldur's Gate 3 Can't Dual Wield ♦ Extra Reach ♦ Finesse ♦ Heavy ♦ Light (Weapon Property) ♦ Loading ♦ Range ♦ Two-Handed ♦ Versatile",
