Feats are special talents or expertise that provide special capabilities to characters. At certain levels, your character will get to choose between an Ability Score Improvement Feature or a Feat. (Note this feat is not available in EA and all info is subject to change.)\n\nDungeon Delver Information\n\nYou gain Advantage on Perception Checks made to detect hidden objects and on Saving Throws made to avoid or resist traps. You gain Resistance to the damage dealt by traps.

Giving them advantage just makes things easier for you. You can use Enhance Ability (Owl's Wisdom) to give them an advantage in spotting these things, which can save you a feat. But if you don't have someone that can cast Enhance Ability, it's not a bad one to take. As of Patch 5, this feat is broken, providing no advantage for trap detection rolls, while the damage reduction seems quite buggy, sometimes halving damage, and sometimes reducing it to 0.\n\nAll Feats in Baldur's Gate 3 Ability Improvements ♦ Actor ♦ Alert ♦ Athlete ♦ Charger ♦ Crossbow Expert ♦ Defensive Duellist ♦ Dual Wielder ♦ Durable ♦ Elemental Adept ♦ Great Weapon Master ♦ Heavily Armoured ♦ Heavy Armour Master ♦ Lightly Armoured ♦ Lucky (Feat) ♦ Mage Slayer ♦ Magic Initiate: Bard ♦ Magic Initiate: Cleric ♦ Magic Initiate: Druid ♦ Magic Initiate: Sorcerer ♦ Magic Initiate: Warlock ♦ Magic Initiate: Wizard ♦ Martial Adept ♦ Medium Armour Master ♦ Mobile ♦ Moderately Armoured ♦ Observant ♦ Performer ♦ Polearm Master ♦ Resilient ♦ Ritual Caster ♦ Savage Attacker ♦ Sentinel ♦ Sharpshooter ♦ Shield Master ♦ Skilled ♦ Spell Sniper ♦ Tavern Brawler ♦ Tough ♦ Unstable Blood ♦ War Caster ♦ Weapon Master",
