  "content": "Multiplayer in Baldur's Gate 3 allows players to join others for cooperative-only play, be it over the internet or via LAN. Baldur's Gate 3 Early Access supports 4-player online multiplayer, but split-screen will not be immediately available on launch. In 4-player online multiplayer, players can either start a multiplayer journey together and both create their own custom character (the origin character will not be available as the main player character at the start of Early Access) or join a friend's single-player game during the adventure. In this case, they will take over a companion.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Multiplayer Information\n\nHow to play Multiplayer in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nPlayers will be able to access multiplayer right in the main menu screen by selecting the multiplayer option, create a multiplayer lobby, and change the option to have only your friends join, and lastly invite your friends. Once complete, simply click on Launch then you and your friends will be able to create your own characters and start into the game. However, the progress and journey that you and your friends experience will only be saved onto the host's computer. That being said, the host needs to remain the same and be in the lobby as well.\n\nIf a player disconnects from the lobby, control of the character will be assigned to someone else in the party that is still connected. The host can simply adjust character assignments by opening the Session Menu. Saving the session can be done any time, and players will need to make sure to load the same saved game just as like a single player saved session.\n\nHow Multiplayer Works in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nMultiplayer in Baldur's Gate 3 allows players to join their friends adventures or vice versa, with one player being the host. However there are some basic information players will need to know when wanting to experience the multiplayer option.\n\nJoining a single player game that is in progress will take over an existing member in the party rather than importing or creating your own. Starting the multiplayer option right from the main menu will allow players and friends to create characters from scratch, so you wont have to control one of the companions when joining a session. Players are not obligated to stay with their party. However, party members will need to communicate in actions they will take. When players go through dialog scenes, other party members will be able to vote to which dialog option is best. The player who prompted the dialog will be the only one to be able to select the final dialog choice.\n\nSplit-Screen Co-op in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nPlayers will be able to use the same monitor and device to play with a friend in local multiplayer mode, as well as having a full controller support . Although early access only has online and LAN multiplayer, Larian Studios has confirmed that this feature will be available at full release.\n\nOnline multiplayer and Split-Screen Co-op will have some differences. Such as, in online multiplayer, you can team up with 3 other players to join your session. Whereas, for Split-Screen co-op, players will be limited to two players sharing one device with multiple controllers. Players will need to consider the parameters when playing split-screen as it will be a bit more demanding.\n\nDungeon Master Mode in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 will not have a Game Master mode at launch, however there is consideration of including a Dungeon Master mode.\n\nThe closest thing to DM mode players can get to is multiplayer mode. Although, Larian Studios has shown support over modding and community-created content so it is possible that they could add a similar mode to their previous game, Divinity: Original Sin 2's GM mode in Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nPlayers can still enjoy the game's multiplayer mode to share great experiences of the games storyline and quests with friends through online, LAN, and split-screen multiplayer mode.\n\nCrossplay and Cross-Save in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nDoes Baldur's Gate 3 have Crossplay?\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 will not have crossplay. This will not be a feature in Baldur's Gate between PC players and PS5 players.\n\nHowever, crossplay could be available for players on Windows or MacOS.\n\nDoes Baldur's Gate 3 Have Cross-Save?\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 will support cross-save progression between PC, Mac, PS5, as well as support for the Steam Deck, allowing players to transfer saves between platforms and continue your adventure on the go.\n\nWill Baldur's Gate 3 Early Access Saves Be Compatible With the Full Game?\n\nUnfortunately, your Baldur's Gate 3 early access saves will not be carried over to the full game upon release. This means players will have to recreate their character once the game has launched and start a new campaign. Due to the amount of updates and changed made, saves from the early access campaigns will not be compatible with the full version of the game.\n\nHowever it is mentioned that there is a loophole where players who begin their playthrough within 72 hours of the release date will have their saves be carried over. Saves from July 31 onwards will be compatible with newer versions, therefore allowing players to bring over their saved game from early access to the full game.",
