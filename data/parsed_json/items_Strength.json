It affects the distance you can jump and the weight you can carry.\n\nStrength is an Ability in Baldur's Gate 3. Each ability affects a broad range of capabilities, including skills or Spells that a character or a monster can be proficient in.\n\nStrength Information\n\nStrength influences your chance to land a hit (attack roll) and your damage with Strength-based weapons. It affects the distance you can jump and the weight you can carry.\n\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks\n\nAthletics: Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:\n\nYou attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off. You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt mid-jump You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous cur­rents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwa­ter or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\n\nOther Strength Checks:\n\nForce open a stuck, locked, or barred door Break free of bonds Push through a tunnel that is too small Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it Tip over a statue Keep a boulder from rolling\n\nAttack Rolls and Damage\n\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack\n\nLifting and Carrying\n\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\n\nCarrying Capacity: Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it Push, Drag, or Lift: You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet Size and Strength: Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights\n\nVariant Encumbrance\n\nIf you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.\n\nIf you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\n\nStrength Tips & Notes\n\nIn Other Languages\n\nDeutsch (Deutschland): Stärke Español (España): Fuerza Italiano (Italia) : Forza\n\nAbilities Charisma ♦ Constitution ♦ Dexterity ♦ Intelligence ♦ Wisdom",
