  "content": "Character Creation in Baldur's Gate 3 covers information regarding the customization mechanic for creating a character. The customization may allow you to freely choose the appearance of your character, from selecting the gender, and race, to choosing various parts of the facial structure, body appearance, and many more.\n\nCharacter Customization in Baldur's Gate 3 expands beyond simple aesthetic choices but creates the personality and the core of the character which will in turn affect the game. The game will react to your character combination based on your Race, Background, and Class. This will further affect your available Abilities, Proficiencies, dialogue options, and how your character interacts with different environments and personalities in the game along with the success rate of their interactions. How you create your character will determine how the game reacts to you. Character Creation is where players can create their own Builds and view details and traits that can define created characters.\n\nBG3 Character Creation Guide\n\nBG3 Character Creation Class Tips\n\nClick to jump to a specific section of the page\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Character Creation\n\nWhat does Character Creation affect in BG3\n\nThe Character Creation process in Baldur's Gate 3 features a few steps where players can customize each section before proceeding to the next stage. This is more than just aesthetic or appearance preferences. Developers have emphasized how the game reacts to your character based on who they are. Players will not only be creating a character and deciding on how they look, but also defining their identity during this stage which includes the character's history. Baldur's Gate 3 really expands on the different interactive elements of the game, making sure the experiences are unique for each character since the game relies on the narrative of the game. This means you can modify your character and play through the game again with another Character Creation and have a different experience especially now that multiclassing is being implemented. Choosing different Backgrounds will also give players access to unique Quests that wouldn't otherwise be experienced unless they play through each of the available character options. Your choices begin from Character Creation and affect your available interactions which will then further shape the narrative and the trajectory of the story.\n\nMulticlassing and Changing Classes in BG3\n\nIt has been confirmed that Multiclassing is a feature that will be introduced in Baldur's Gate 3. Multiclassing is the ability to switch to another character. Players will now be able to make changes and completely reset their Class in-game after encountering an in-game character without having to restart the game and undergo the Character Creation process again. Players who have played through the Early Acess may find this character familiar and he can be encountered int eh early stages of Act 1. This allows players to then reinvest all their levels without having to put in an extensive amount of extra effort starting from the beginning and no longer have any Ability Score requirements. This encourages players to experiment with multiclassing and gives them more freedom when creating a Build.\n\nRespec a Character in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, you will be able to Respec your characters as many times as you want, as long as they you the required gold and have already added Withers to the Camp. Approach to him and select Respec among the services he provides. Withers will ask for 100 gold pieces for his service. The price of the service DOES NOT increase during the course of the game, nor if you use it frequently.\n\nAny character can interact with Withers to Respec, even your Companions, if they pay the asking price. Note that respecing a character does not change its interactions or Quests.\n\nWhy was Character Customization Layout Changed from Early Access?\n\nA look into the Character Creation page quickly shows the notable difference from the initial Character Creation menus seen on Baldur's Gate 3 Early Access. This was newly organized to clearly present all needed information about the selections of each step in the creation. This layout makes the early game process more inclusive to players new to the Dungeons & Dragon games so that they get a better idea of what choices made during these initial steps could impact later on in the game. Big games like Baldur's Gate 3 will contain a lot of information for new players to process and the developers were looking to capture a wider audience so this layout breaks it down a little easier in a step-by-step process to welcome and encourage new players to play the game and be immersed from the start of the game.\n\nItemization and Builds in BG3\n\nPlayers who wish to go through the first playthrough blind of without guides might not need to note the items in game since they will learn about them as they are encountered, but those who wish to thoroughly plan out their Build can now refer to all available Items, Weapons, and Armor to see how they are obtained or for which Class, Races or Background would best suit any items you would want to use. View all Items, Weapons and Armor on their respective page, how to get them, and if they have any requirements then, you can focus your Build on that. However, as you progress through the game and gain better items, your Build can evolve along with your items especially with the implemented Multiclassing feature and the ability to Respecc.\n\nWho do you dream of? Who attracts you?\n\nAfter your character is created, you will have a chance to choose Who do you dream of? Who attracts you? This choice does not limit your romance options in-game. However, while camping at night, you will have dreams featuring this mysterious entity.\n\nNew Character Customization Details in BG3\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 offers a new in-depth Character Creation and Customization system to give players the ability to express how they want to portray their characters and make their imaginations a reality, which is an important aspect in all Dungeons & Dragon games. This gives players additional customization options that adjust according to the chosen Race. After choosing the desired race, players can customize unique features found on the character such as Horns and Tails, which are not found on all characters. This also introduces the two new Races in the game, Half-Orc and Dragonborn-- which each display unique characteristics, attachments, and appearances that can be customized. This expands the appearance possibilities and allows for more freedom expression when creating unique looks for each character.\n\nExpanded Character Creation Toolbox in BG3\n\nYour character's identity is the core of the game and your interactions in the game revolve around who you have created, which is why it was important to pay such attention to details to the character-creating process at the start of the game. The creation of your character is part of the experience and your choices during this stage will further impact your experiences and choices as you play. It is important that players had a lot of room for expression during this stage to match the desired appearances with each character's identity.\n\nThe Character Creation appearances menu includes a large palette of colors and customizability from the hair, eyes, and skin and additional details specific to certain races like horns, tails and jaw structure. Additional details were also given attention, allowing players to not only add specific minor details but also adjust the intensity of them. This includes being able to adjust the maturity and the intensity of the freckles on the character if any. During the showcase, viewers also witness the customization process and a rundown of the different menu options. Viewers noticed an option to customize the character's genitalia and the ability to toggle 'Hide Clothes' to see the effects of the changes. Developers did not pinpoint the feature, but it was seen on the appearance customization menu. All in all, this displays the great lengths and extensiveness of the customization abilities in the game, taking into account different conditions for inclusivity and variety such as Vitiligo and Heterochromia.\n\nIntroducing Dragonborn and Half-Orc to Baldur's Gate 3\n\nThe developers were happy to announce the introduction of a few new Races to the Baldur's Gate roster. Players can play as Half-Orc and Dragonborn characters if they want to elevate their fantasy experience. Developers paid special attention to details when creating and designing the Dragonborn, which was the most technically challenging since they are the most diverse and furthest from the other humanoid races. Developers had to consider the different ways the details of the Dragonborn can vary and how their scales react to the lighting. They've expressed giving the lighter shades and white colours additional attention by adding a pearlescent finish.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Step-by-Step Character Creation Process\n\nOrigins in Baldur's Gate 3 Character Creation\n\nOrigins are like pre-made Characters that can be selected during Character Creation if players do not wish to undergo specific Customization options. Each Origin character will have different backgrounds and Classes that will also affect gameplay and interactions. Players who want to be a part of each step of the customization can opt for a Custom character while on this menu. Players who choose not to go with an Origin character may have a chance to engage with them as Companions except for The Dark Urge.\n\nRogue - High Elf - Noble\n\nGithyanki - Fighter - Soldier\n\nHuman - Wizard - Sage\n\nHigh Half-Elf - Cleric - Trickery Domain - Urchin\n\nHuman - Warlock - The Fiend\n\nAsmodeus Tiefling - Barbarian\n\nGeneral Customization Options in Baldurs Gate 3\n\nPlayers can toggle and modify a variety of individual features for their character. These customization options may vary depending on your character selection choices and character Race. Players can also opt to randomize their features and modify them from there.\n\nBody Type: Players will have four body types to choose from that will modify the physical build of the character Identity: Choose between Male, Female, and Non-Binary/Other. Voice: Play through a few voice-acting options for your character Face: There will be a total of 8 premade facial feature combinations to choose from Skin Colour: Browse through the different skin tones to change the pigment of the character's skin Scarring: There will be a few pre-made facial markings for players to choose from Genitals: Players can modify the character's genitals. Toggle 'Hide Clothes' to see the changes Crest: Choose from different Crest designs (specific to Dragonborn) Chins: Choose from different Chin designs (specific to Dragonborn) Jaws: Choose from different Jaw designs (specific to Dragonborn)\n\nFurther Customization:\n\nThe following customization options are edited with a slider to determine how intense or how much of the following features players would like to see on their character.\n\nMaturity Freckle Quantity Freck Intensity Vitiligo Pigmentation\n\nOther Customization Options\n\nAside from the general customization options players can also choose to further modify other specific features on their character. Each section will have a dedicated menu for customizing each part and feature. The available menu options may change depending on your Race choice, for example, Dragonborn characters will have an added Tail customization option menu while Tiefling characters have horns that can also be customized.\n\nBody Art: Body Art includes adding Tattoos -- Choose from a variety of Style options, then modify the colour-- as well as piercing styles. Eyes: Modify the colour of your character's eyes and be able to toggle Heterochromia from this menu, which allows players to select two different eye colours, one for each eye. Makeup Hair: Players will be able to switch out the character's Hairstyle and modify the Hair Colour, Highlights, and Greying of the hair. Each customizable option will display colour palette players can choose from and modify the colours of the highlights and the type of grey and intensity of the colour. Facial Hair: Players can choose a desired facial hairstyle if preferred and also further modify the colour and Greying intensity Tail: A race-specific customization where players can customize seen on Dragonborn characters Horns: A specific feature seen on Tiefling characters where players can choose a specific style, Horn Colour or even change the colour of the Horn Tip.\n\nNew Races in Baldurs Gate 3\n\nBaldurs Gate 3 adds new races to the game for players to experience. Players can now choose to create Dragonborn or Half-Orc characters, which provides a whole new set of Subrace options as well as additional appearance customization options including additional Chin and Jaw details and Tail features.\n\nAll Races in Baldur's Gate 3 Character Creation\n\nSelect from a variety of Races available in Baldur's Gate 3. Hover over each Race in order to display their in-game description while undergoing the Character Creation process. This will also display their available Race Features and will determine the options available for the next step in Character Creation when choosing a Subrace, which will be directly related to your selected Race.\n\nChoosing a Race in Baldur's Gate 3 now differs from tabletop gameplay. When choosing a Race, players had to consider the appropriate Ability Scores that would best suit their desired class, with some being obviously better matches than others. In Baldur's Gate 3, developers wanted to remove these constrictions so your Class can be considered a little less when choosing a Race. This is to encourage players to experiment and have fun with the different Race and Class combinations without much consequences when it comes to their stats. Instead, when choosing a Race, players can consider their interactions and dialogue options during gameplay and focus on the available Race Features that come with each Race which will be displayed just below the Race description during the Race selection menu in Character Creation. Players can also look at the character bar on the right when creating a character to take a look at the Proficiencies your choices give you. You can take into account which Weapons you generally gravitate towards or which Weapons will best suit your playstyle and then adjust your Race options according to which ones will give you the proficiency for your preferred Weapon or Equipment. If you choose a race that happens to not have the proficiency you need, you can also browse through the Classes and Backgrounds to gain the Proficiency you are looking for. Another thing to consider is the size of your Race and character since this will actually affect your movement speed. This will be most noticeable during Combat. To sum it up when choosing a Race, consider a few factors when moving forward. This could be adjusted anytime while in the Character Creation menu before you proceed. Players can also consider trying the newly added Races for a new experience.\n\nThings to Consider when Choosing a Race:\n\nRace Features Movement Speed Proficiencies Available Subraces\n\nAll Races in BG3\n\nAll Classes in Baldurs Gate 3 Character Creation\n\nFrom the Character Creation Classes menu, players will be able to access each Class's description, Actions, and Class Features. Click on the details button for more details when choosing a class.\n\nChanging Classes Mid-Game in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nDevelopers have announced during their Panel from Hell Release Showcase that players will have a chance to meet an in-game character that can be interacted with and allows you to change your class mid-game without having to restart the whole game. Players can then experiment with Multi-classing and decide which Classes best complement each other through gameplay.\n\nChoosing a Class in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nWhen choosing a Class, you will want to look at the available Subclasses that each Class has to offer. Once you have chosen a class, you can start distributing your Ability Scores. You can be a certain Ability Point-centered version of your character by assigning your Ability Points According across Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma depending on what type of combat or interactions you want to have. This will further affect how you will play the game, where you position your character, and whether you are a tank at the frontlines of combat or not. Those who prefer Melee Combat will go for Strength, Intelligence, or Constitution for heavier Armor equipment and better HP stats, while a ranged warrior will go for Dexterity instead rather than strength. This is just an example of how you can approach creating a build.\n\nRespeccing your Build\n\nThis respect or multiclassing feature allows players to reallocate Attribute points in order to modify their Builds mid-game. Players can keep in mind that even when they choose a class in Character Creation, it will not prevent them from trying other classes later on. This is done through an NPC interaction that is encountered early game.\n\nAll Subclasses in Baldurs Gate 3 Character Creation\n\nAfter selecting a Class during character creation, players can further customize their character classes from the Subclass menu, which is specific to the chosen Class. Each Class will have a dedicated set of subclasses to choose from which will affect your available Actions and will give you a Subclass Feature. Additional Customization may also appear once you have selected your desired Subclass.\n\nCleric: Life Domain ♦ Light Domain ♦ Trickery Domain ♦ Knowledge Domain ♦ Nature Domain ♦ Tempest Domain ♦ War Domain Fighter: Battle Master ♦ Eldritch Knight ♦ Champion Ranger: Beast Master ♦ Hunter ♦ Gloom Stalker Rogue: Thief ♦ Arcane Trickster ♦ Assassin Warlock: The Fiend ♦ The Great Old One ♦ Archfey Wizard: Abjuration School ♦ Conjuration School ♦ Divination School ♦ Enchantment School ♦ Evocation School ♦ Necromancy School ♦ Illusion School ♦ Transmutation School Druid: Circle of the Moon ♦ Circle of the Land ♦ Circle of Spores Sorcerer: Draconic Bloodline ♦ Wild Magic ♦ Storm Sorcery Barbarian: Berserker ♦ Wildheart ♦ Wild Magic Bard: College of Lore ♦ College of Valour ♦ College of Swords Paladin: Oath of Devotion ♦ Oath of the Ancients ♦ Oath of Vengeance ♦ Oathbreaker Monk: Way of the Open Hand ♦ Way of Shadow ♦ Way of the Four Elements\n\nAll Backgrounds in Baldurs Gate 3 Character Creation\n\nBackgrounds determine each character's starting Proficiencies and will affect the success of their interactions in game. All Backgrounds will be available regardless of which Race or Class is chosen.\n\nAcolyte: Insight Proficiency, Religion Proficiency Charlatan: Deception Proficiency, Sleight of Hand Proficiency Entertainer: Acrobatics Proficiency, Performance Proficiency Folk Hero: Animal Handling Proficiency, Survival Proficiency Guild Artisan: Insight Proficiency, Persuasion Proficiency Noble: History Proficiency, Persuasion Proficiency Hermit: Medicine Proficiency, Religion Proficiency Outlander: Athletics Proficiency, Survival Proficiency Sage: Arcana Proficiency, History Proficiency Sailor: Athletics Proficiency, Perception Proficiency Soldier: Athletics Proficiency, Intimidation Proficiency Urchin: Sleight of Hand Proficiency, Stealth Proficiency\n\nCharacter Results\n\nFinal Character Stats Baldur's Gate 3\n\nAfter going through each of the Character Creation steps, modifying and customizing your character's appearances and choosing their Race, Class, Subclass, and Background along with each corresponding additional customization menu that appears, you will have your final results displayed on the right side of your displayed character that you have created.\n\nThis displays, your character's final starting Stats, Cantrips, Actions and Proficiencies. Players can then review all this information before proceeding.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Character Creation Guides\n\nCharacter Creation Tips Baldur's Gate 3\n\nThe initial Character Creation process is when players have the opportunity to create a build. Serious players can take a look at all the stats affected by the changes in each aspect after every step of the creation process. Players can also consider what their playstyle or combat style is when undergoing each step. To break it down, players can choose which parts they want to prioritize whether there is a particular Race, Background, or Class they want to play. Everything else can be chosen to complement that in a build. Players usually start off by choosing a desired Race and then choose a Class to suit the Race. After this process, you can take a look at how to increase your Ability Scores. Race is a very important choice in character creation because it affects your itemization and could make items perform better depending on your Race. Choose carefully because though multiclassing is an added feature, players will be unable to change their Race.\n\nCasual players who just want to play a game can refer to pre-made Builds made or recommended by other players. These are usually made considering different playstyles. The Build page has a number of builds and recommendations anyone can try out. Players can also consider choosing from the available Origins in Character Creation.\n\nAbility Score 16 for Baldur's Gate 3 Builds\n\nThe reason it's important to select Races that increase your Ability Score for the primary Ability of your Class is that you want to hit 16 in that Ability during Character Creation 99% of the time. You can only hit 15 without gaining a boost from your Race during Character Creation, so this makes it pretty much a must.\n\nOdd Ability Scores don't provide you with any extra benefit, so it's important you get that additional point to get to 16, to get and extra +1 to your Attack Rolls/Damage Rolls or Spell DC, as well as Saving Throws and other bonuses. No matter what Build you select, it's a good idea to aim for even values during Character Creation, and shoot for getting your Primary Attribute to 16:\n\nCleric and Druid: Wisdom 16 Fighter and Ranger: Strength 16 - Melee versions that don't Dual Wield Fighter, Ranger and Rogue: Dexterity 16 - Dual Wielders and Ranged variants Wizard: Intelligence 16 Warlock and Paladin: Charisma 16\n\nChoosing a Race, Background, and Class in BG3\n\nThe Best Builds in Baldur's Gate 3 focus on optimizing Character Creation with the intention of min/maxing, knowing exactly how many Levels each Build can take, and how many Levels of each Class are needed (in the case of Multiclassing). Trial and error is needed to achieve this in many cases, since enemy composition plays a role in what Spells and Class Features are more useful than others. Tailoring Builds to the exact things you'll be facing in Baldur's Gate 3 is a huge part of what makes specific Builds better than ones you might find in regular DnD 5E. If you're looking for the Best Builds in Baldur's Gate 3, you can choose from any of the following.\n\nBest Melee Builds\n\nDruid - Circle of the Moon Barbarian - Berserker Bard - College of Valour Fighter - Eldritch Knight Warlock - Melee Rogue - Thief Paladin - Oath of Devotion\n\nBest Ranged Builds\n\nWarlock - The Fiend Ranger - Hunter Cleric - Light Domain Wizard - Evocation School Sorcerer - Dragon Ancestor\n\nPlayers also have the option to choose an Origin at the start of Character Creation if they don't prefer to make a custom build. Origin Characters are pre-designed characters that are selected during Character Creation where players can step into the shoes of these pre-made characters and start their adventure. Origin Characters for Baldur's Gate 3 are equipped with stats, unique personal backstories, exclusive quests, motivations, and distinct interactions with the world. This is an advantage to better understand the lore and background for each of the available Origin Characters. If you choose not to play as an Origin character, some of these Origin character may also then be encountered and recruited as a Companion.\n\nAll Origin Characters Baldur's Gate 3\n\nAstarion prowled the night as a vampire spawn for centuries, serving a sadistic master until he was snatched away. Now he can walk in the light, but can he leave his wicked past behind?\n\nLae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people.\n\nGale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerûn has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city.\n\nOne of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides.\n\nNoble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.\n\nFresh-escaped from Hell, Karlach is finally free of the archdevil Zariel - but not from the infernal engine Zariel planted in her chest. But even more premier in her mind? Exploring, finding like-minded travelers, falling in love (or lust)...\n\nYou remember nothing of your past besides that you walked a path paved with blood. As you venture on, you find yourself inescapably drawn towards unimaginable cruelties. Where do these thoughts come from?\n\nThe Dark Urge in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nWhat is the Dark Urge in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nDuring the Panel from Hell showcase, it was revealed that The Dark Urge is the additional origin character that players can select in the Character Creation section of the game. Unlike other Origin Characters, The Dark Urge is a fully customizable Origin avatar where players can play as whichever Race, Class, appearance, gender and overall build that they would like while maintaining the origin story of The Dark Urge. The Dark Urge origin is also not associated with any Companions in Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nCustomized \"The Dark Urge\" avatar selected by chat during the Panel of Hell showcase.\n\nThe Dark Urge is quite unique in Baldur's Gate 3 since the sequences and interactions that are featured are unexpected and it challenges your perception of how to tackle different situations. As you choose to play the origin of The Dark Urge its history is unknown but you awaken to be someone who has dark thoughts that plague your mind and ultimately push you to commit atrocious acts throughout the journey. The choice is completely yours — will you fight what is twisting your mind to be good or will you succumb to madness and wreak chaos?\n\nWhat is the Gameplay of the Dark Urge?\n\nUpon starting your journey with the origin of The Dark Urge, the story will include a sinister voice of a narrator that speaks of the different impulses that are going on in your character's mind. This unique feature alone changes the many ways of interactions, as well as cutscenes that you haven't seen and dialogues for you to choose from, and at length, its origin story that unfolds. As The Dark Urge, we highly recommend that players enjoy every cutscene and dialogue there is available to it.\n\nCan I Resist Evil Choices as The Dark Urge?\n\nYes, the choice is completely yours if you play the origin of The Dark Urge. Unlike any other characters or even the player's customized avatar, the Dark Urge will have its own unique cutscenes and dialogue options for different scenarios, and whatever you choose will result in different outcomes. One example that was featured during the Panel from Hell showcase was: during the exploration of a crash site with Shadowheart, the player starts to loot the bodies of goblins and a cutscene triggers where the Narrator reminds you of how the sight of blood and violence gives you pleasure. You then choose if you try to push the smile away, to let that grin fall across your face, or with enough Intelligence, you try to remember the last time you stood above a corpse.\n\nAnother example is when Gale reaches his hand out from a portal and asks for help, you are given unique choices such as fantasizing about cutting off the hand, and by doing so, your urges have led you to hacking off his hand. With this, you acquire Gale's severed hand which is a new branching point of interaction and scenarios that are unique and exclusive to The Dark Urge origin. As you dive into its origin, you'll learn what causes these twisted thoughts and experience the dark counterpoint of the game's main storyline.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Character Creation Comparison Tables\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Races Table\n\nIf you are having trouble picking your race, use this table to compare the racial attributes available in BG3.

Gloom Stalker No Gloom stalkers are at home in the darkest places: deep under the earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a gloom stalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats before they can reach the broader world. Such rangers are often found in the Underdark, but they will go any place where evil lurks in the shadows. Rogue Thief Yes Thieves use their skills in stealth and larceny to acquire whatever they wish, whether from a third story window or the depths of long-forgotten ruins.

Archfey No Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born.

Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags. Wizard Abjuration School Yes Abjuration spells summon wards, banish enemies, and nullify magic, suitable for those who wish to defend themselves and others.

As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant. Divination School No The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight. Enchantment School No As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between. Illusion School No You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists – including many gnome wizards – are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain. Necromancy School No The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate. Transmutation School No You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge. Druid Circle of the Moon Yes The Circle of the Moon Subclass has a much heavier focus on the Wild Shape Class Feature of the Druid. If you like shapeshifting, and want to do so more effectively then you'll likely enjoy this Subclass. Circle of the Land Yes The Circle of the Land Subclass has a heavy focus on the use of Nature Magic, and allows the Druid to regain some Spells after a Short Rest. Circle of Spores No Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form. Sorcerer Draconic Bloodline Yes Your veins carry draconic magic, the result of a powerful dragon ancestor. Wild Magic Yes Your powers come from ancient forces of chaos. They churn withing you - waiting to burst free at any time. Storm Sorcery No Whether crackling with the energy of ancient deluges or pierced by gales and hurricanes, your lineage is a strange tapestry scrawled by a tempest. Barbarian Berserker Yes Violence is both a means and an end. You follow a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood, as you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own well-being. Wildheart Yes Your attunement with nature and its beasts inspires your rage, empowering you with supernatural might. Wild Magic No Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic. These magic-suffused barbarians walk the Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest the otherworldly magic of their ancestors. Bard College of Lore Yes You pursue beauty and truth, collecting knowledge from scholarly tomes to peasants' tales, and use your gifts to hold both audiences and enemies spellbound. College of Valour Yes You wander the land to witness and relate the deeds of the mighty, keeping alive the memory of heroes of the past and inspiring heroes of the future. College of Swords No Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right. Paladin Oath of the Ancients Yes You fight on the side of light in the cosmic struggle against darkness to preserve the sanctity of life and the beauty of nature. Oath of Devotion Yes Following the ideal of the knight in shining armour, you act with honour and virtue to protect the weak and pursue the greater good. Oathbreaker Yes You have broken your sacred Oath in pursuit of power and ambition. Only darkness remains to fuel you now. Oath of Vengeance No You have set aside even your own purity to right wrongs and deliver justice to those who have committed the most grievous sins. Monk Way of the Open Hand No Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. Way of Shadow No Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students. Way of the Four Elements No These monks 'bend' the four elements at will, becoming 'avatars' of balance.\n\nKnowledge Domain\n\nArcane Trickster\n\nThe Great Old One\n\nAbjuration School\n\nEvocation School\n\nConjuration School\n\nDivination School\n\nEnchantment School\n\nNecromancy School\n\nTransmutation School\n\nCircle of the Moon\n\nCircle of the Land\n\nCircle of Spores\n\nDraconic Bloodline\n\nCollege of Valour\n\nCollege of Swords\n\nOath of the Ancients\n\nOath of Devotion\n\nOath of Vengeance\n\nWay of the Open Hand\n\nWay of the Four Elements\n\nBG3 Background Proficiencies\n\nInsight Proficiency\n\nAcolyte Guild Artisan\n\nReligion Proficiency\n\nDeception Proficiency\n\nCharlatan Criminal\n\nSleight of Hand Proficiency\n\nCharlatan Urchin\n\nStealth Proficiency\n\nAcrobatics Proficiency\n\nPerformance Proficiency\n\nAnimal Handling Proficiency\n\nSurvival Proficiency\n\nFolk Hero Outlander\n\nPersuasion Proficiency\n\nGuild Artisan Noble\n\nHistory Proficiency\n\nMedicine Proficiency\n\nAthletics Proficiency\n\nOutlander Sailor Soldier\n\nArcana Proficiency\n\nPerception Proficiency\n\nIntimidation Proficiency",
