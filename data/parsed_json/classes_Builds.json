  "content": "Builds for Baldur's Gate 3 in 2023 are player-created playable setups featuring BG3's different Classes, and Multiclasses along with their Races, Weapons, Armor, Abilities, Skills, Feats, and Features, that defines a specific array of playstyle or highlight a certain natural strength of a class or a character. Builds in Baldur's Gate 3 have a particular emphasis on Character Creation, since Classes don't gain many Ability Points or Feats beyond this, and selections are quite limited when leveling, unlike some other RPGs.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Builds\n\nThe Best Builds in Baldur's Gate 3 focus on optimizing Character Creation with the intention of min/maxing, knowing exactly how many Levels each Build can take, and how many Levels of each Class are needed (in the case of Multiclassing). Trial and error is needed to achieve this in many cases, since enemy composition plays a role in what Spells and Class Features are more useful than others. Tailoring Builds to the exact things you'll be facing in Baldur's Gate 3 is a huge part of what makes specific Builds better than ones you might find in regular DnD 5E. If you're looking for the Best Builds in Baldur's Gate 3, you can choose from any of the following.\n\nBG3 Builds by Class\n\nBarbarian Builds Bard Builds Cleric Builds Druid Builds Fighter Builds Monk Builds Paladin Builds Ranger Builds Rogue Builds Sorcerer Builds Warlock Builds Wizard Builds\n\nBest Builds by Rank\n\nDruid - Circle of the Moon Warlock - The Fiend Bard - College of Valour Ranger - Hunter Fighter - Eldritch Knight Barbarian - Berserker Warlock - Melee Cleric - Light Domain Rogue - Thief Wizard - Evocation School Sorcerer - Dragon Ancestor Paladin - Oath of Devotion\n\nBest Melee Builds\n\nDruid - Circle of the Moon Barbarian - Berserker Bard - College of Valour Fighter - Eldritch Knight Warlock - Melee Rogue - Thief Paladin - Oath of Devotion\n\nBest Ranged Builds\n\nWarlock - The Fiend Ranger - Hunter Cleric - Light Domain Wizard - Evocation School Sorcerer - Dragon Ancestor\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Builds - The Basics\n\nThe first thing to figure out when making a Build in Baldur's Gate 3 is what Class you want to play. Don't worry about what Race you want to play or what Background you want or Ability Scores (Attribute Points), until you've made this decision. Look through the Classes and find the one you want. In some cases you'll also be able to choose your Subclass during Character Creation as well, but not always.\n\nOnce you've chosen your Class, and Subclass if applicable, you'll need to select a Race that is best suited to that Class. This isn't 100% necessary, so you can choose whichever Race you want, but if you're trying to optimize your Build 100% then this is your best course of action.\n\nRespec a Character in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, you will be able to Respec your characters as many times as you want, as long as you have the required gold and have already added Withers to the Camp. Approach to him and select Respec among the services he provides. Withers will ask for 100 gold pieces for his service. The price of the service DOES NOT increase during the course of the game, nor if you use it frequently. (Note: Withers will never turn hostile so you can steal your gold back. )\n\nAny character can interact with Withers to Respec, even your Companions, if they pay the asking price. Note that respecing a character does not change its interactions or Quests.\n\nBG3 Builds - Everything You Should Know\n\nChoosing a Race for Your Build in BG3\n\nThere are really a few things to think about when selecting a Race for your Build, and the first is Ability Points. Does that Race give you any Ability Score improvement towards the Abilities that best benefit your Class. For instance, if you're playing a Cleric, selecting a Race that provides some benefit to Wisdom would be optimal, since Clerics use Wisdom to cast their Spells. These Races include Wood Elf, Human, and Gold Dwarf.\n\nOnce you've found the ones with increase Wisdom, you'll want to look at what other benefits they provide, such as the Wood Elf's Fleet of Foot or the Gold Dwarf's Dwarven Toughness. Use these things to help you make the best decision possible.\n\nAbility Score 16 For Baldur's Gate 3 Builds\n\nThe reason it's important to select Races that increase your Ability Score for the primary Ability of your Class is that you want to hit 16 in that Ability during Character Creation 99% of the time. You can only hit 15 without gaining a boost from your Race during Character Creation, so this makes it pretty much a must.\n\nOdd Ability Scores don't provide you with any extra benefit, so it's important you get that additional point to get to 16, to get and extra +1 to your Attack Rolls/Damage Rolls or Spell DC, as well as Saving Throws and other bonuses. No matter what Build you select, it's a good idea to aim for even values during Character Creation, and shoot for getting your Primary Attribute to 16:\n\nCleric and Druid: Wisdom 16 Fighter and Ranger: Strength 16 - Melee versions that don't Dual Wield Fighter, Ranger and Rogue: Dexterity 16 - Dual Wielders and Ranged variants Wizard: Intelligence 16 Warlock and Paladin: Charisma 16\n\nIn your adventure, there are some items that gives you extra ability score, or set your ability score to a fixed number. (Such as Amulet of Greater Health, which increases the wearer's Constitution score to 23.) When you acquire these items, you can ask Withers to respec your character, move you ability score to another stat to further improve your builds.\n\nThere's also a unique item called Mirror of Loss that can gives you additional ability score, check the page for mor info.\n\nBest Builds in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nBlazing Battlemage: Eldritch Knight\n\nMonk Multiclass Builds\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Builds: Newly Added - Builds by Class\n\nBG3 Barbarian Builds\n\nThree early game builds for levels 1-6, showcasing the Barbarian class options.

These will be adjusted at launch to include things I've learned since making them, as well as adding in information about additional levels and where to take these Builds past Level 4, once the level cap in the full game is raised.\n\nCleric Builds ♦ Druid Builds ♦ Fighter Builds ♦ Ranger Builds ♦ Rogue Builds ♦ Warlock Builds ♦ Wizard Builds ♦ Druid Builds ♦ Sorcerer Builds ♦ Paladin Builds\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Build Guide: Sorcerer: Sorcerers are well-known for their magical prowess that stems from an ancient bloodline, unchecked chaotic magic, or mysterious circumstances. Unlike Warlocks, they don’t depend on patrons for the strength of their Spells and far from Wizards, arcane books are not essential to further develop their capabilities. One Class Feature that distinguishes them from other Spellcasters is their ability to incorporate Metamagic to manipulate the way Spells work to their liking, making them versatile. This also compensates for their lack of Armour Proficiency as it allows them to take charge in Combat.\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 Build Guide: Druid: Druids are Divine Spellcasters that not only cast damaging spells, but can also heal and take the shape of different creatures via their Wild Shape Class Feature. Wild Shape is what really sets the Druid apart from other Classes, and in Early Access Druids can currently change into 7 different animals including: Dire Wolf, Raven, Badger, Polar Bear, Cat, Deep Rothe, Spider and Aberrant Intellect Devourer, but more are expected upon full release of the game.\n\nWarlock Guide & Builds\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Build Guide: Warlock: Warlocks in Baldur’s Gate 3 are extremely powerful because of their Cantrip Eldritch Blast that does between 1-10 damage every use from 18m away, and Cantrips can be cast every turn without using up Spell Slots. Additionally, they have some very good spells that deal AoE damage, and they can also melee effectively because of Pact of the Blade.\n\nEldritch Knight Build\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Build Guide: Eldritch Knight: Fighters can become Eldritch Knights at Level 3 in Baldur’s Gate 3, and when they do so they gain access to some Wizard spells. In Early Access they will only be able to gain a maximum of 3 Level 1 spells, which isn’t a huge amount. However, these can be used hit targets from far away, or to do devastating AoE attacks when in melee range.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Build Guide: Hunter: Rangers can become Hunters at Level 3 in Baldur’s Gate 3, and when they do they gain the choice of a powerful passives. Colossus Slayer will provide an extra 1-8 damage to any target they hit with a weapon attack. Since the damage from the attack is calculated before Colossus Slayer is determined, this works with full health targets, even though the description makes it seem as though it does not. This allows Hunters to deal incredible damage every round, without expending any resources.\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 Build Guide: Cleric: Clerics choose their Domain during Character Creation and for this Build, I’m going to be showing you my Light Domain setup. The reason I chose Light Domain is that I wanted to make a Cleric that could deal good damage and still have some support Spells, and Light Domain does a decent job of this. However, you can make this Build for the most part using other Domains in Early Access, but you will miss out on a couple of really strong Spells. Still the concept is basically the same.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Build Guide: Wizard: Wizards in Baldur’s Gate 3 choose their school of magic at level 2, and for Early Access I strongly advise taking the Evocation School. This is because in order to regularly gain the Arcane Ward from the Abjuration School, you need to constantly cast Abjuration Spells. Abjuration Spells do not need to be cast all that often, and even then the Ward you gain is not overly strong. This means you might as well take Evocation, even if you don’t need its passive benefit of guaranteeing allies passing Saving Throws when hit by your Spells all that often.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Build Guide: Thief: Rogues in Baldur's Gate 3 can become Thiefs at Level 3, and I advise choosing this Subclass over the Arcane Trickster in Early Access if you are new to the game. This is because Thiefs gain an extra Bonus Action, and they can use this for Shoving, Jumping, or even on their Cunning Action: Dash. This allows them to still attack with both their main-hand and off-hand Weapons after taking a Bonus Action, OR get an additional off-hand weapon attack if they didn't use a Bonus Action for anything else.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Build Guide: Barbarian: Barbarians are well-known for their Rage together with their innate ability to take advantage of it, which is unseen in any other Class. Anger is what fuels their Strength and subsequent impact in Combat, allowing them to deal massive damage in multiple turns without severe repercussions besides taking a Long Rest here and there. For others, however, their strong bond with nature and animals gives life to their ferocity. Because of these factors, Barbarians are independently resilient and they can carry their weight in encounters when it comes to inflicting melee or ranged damage. This makes them highly skilled warriors.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Build Guide: Bard: Bards wield magic differently compared to other casters in that they seamlessly weave it into the captivating tales they tell and the beautiful tunes they play. Due to their high Charisma, they can easily inspire comrades while crippling foes in and out of Combat. Bards are also adept at protecting themselves from taking too much damage by casting buffs and improving the type of Armor they wear. Unlike Wizards of the Evocation School who focus on primarily casting offensive Spells, Bards often make use of crowd control abilities to manipulate the direction of the fight.\n\nPaladin Guide & Builds\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Build Guide: Paladin: Paladins are powerful divine warriors who are well-known for their offensive and support roles in combat. Not only are they extremely reliable when it comes to dealing consistent Melee Damage due to their Smite Spells but they also excel in aiding allies with Bless and Cure Wounds. To add to the Paladin's versatility, they're also highly charismatic, allowing for interesting (and often) manipulative choices in dialogue to tip the scales in their favor. But they can sometimes get into trouble the moment they stray from their word and break their promise, making them Oathbreakers. Doing so opens up a new playstyle that focuses on inflicting the most carnage while being less of a team player.",
