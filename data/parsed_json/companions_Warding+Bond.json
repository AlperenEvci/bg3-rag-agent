They gain Resistance to all damage, and a +1 bonus to their Armour Class and Saving Throws. Each time the target takes damage, the spellcaster takes the same amount of damage. Each time the warded creature takes damage, the spellcaster takes the same amount of damage. Level: Lvl 2 spell School: Abjuration School Casting Time: Action Range: Requires Concentration: No Saving Throw:\n\nHow to Acquire Warding Bond\n\nWarding Bond can be acquired by the following classes: Cleric Oath of the Crown Warding Bond can be cast by using the following Items: Viconia's Walking Fortress True Love's Embrace\n\nCleric Oath of the Crown\n\nViconia's Walking Fortress True Love's Embrace\n\nWarding Bond Tips & Notes\n\nThis spell can be cast by a hireling and then leave him at camp so you gain all the benefits with practically no downside. Just remember to make sure the hireling has a high enough Constitution save so he won't die too easily. The damage caused to the user is of the same damage type that the bond target received this means it can be resisted or otherwise mitigated for example if a tiefling cleric uses the bond on an ally who takes 20 Fire damage the resistance from the spell will half the damage to 10 then cause that same 10 Fire damage to the user who being resistent to Fire will only take 5 damage Notably, the above also applies to the damage reduction of Adamantine Splint Armour. BUG: Shapeshifted Druids can cause unintended damage to the caster of Warding Bond when engaging in cutscenes/dialogue. Most scenes cannot be done while shapeshifted, so you will either be told you can't do it, control over the dialogue will switch to another party member, or you will forcibly lose shapeshift. But in some cases, a cutscene will allow the user to lose their shapeshift, carry out the cutscene or dialogue, and then revert back to their shapeshifted form afterwards for free. However, any missing health the user has when they revert back to form will be counted as \"damage\" for the caster of warding bond, causing them to take damage equal to the amount of health the druid's form is missing. For example, an owlbear druid with 45/65 health will cause the caster to take 20 damage after the cutscene ends. While normally very rare, this notably includes speaking to your companions, so the best practice is to avoid conversing with them while transformed if you intend to use this combination. (September 5th 2023) BUG: if the spell target is wearing Callous Glow Ring then the ring effect will apply to the redirected damage. If the damage taken from redirect is greater than 0 then the ring will add 2 radiant damage. This is probably due to the game treating the redirect damage as if it is being dealt by the character that it is redirected from. BUG: if the spell caster has any effects which reflect damage whenever they take redirected damage this will reflect damage back to the target of the spell it was redirected from. The damage that is reflected is still treated as if it is being dealt by the character that is redirecting the damage, so if the character that is redirecting is wearing Callous Glow Ring they will do a bonus 2 radiant damage to themselves. This can then be redirected again and can loop around until damage is reduced to 0. More research needed to fully understand what is happening and why.\n\nLvl 2 Spells Aid ♦ Arcane Lock ♦ Barkskin ♦ Blindness ♦ Blur ♦ Branding Smite ♦ Calm Emotions ♦ Chromatic Orb: Acid (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Cold (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Fire (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Lightning (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Poison (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Thunder (Lvl 2) ♦ Cloud of Daggers ♦ Crown of Madness ♦ Darkness ♦ Darkvision ♦ Detect Thoughts ♦ Enhance Ability ♦ Enlarge - Reduce ♦ Enthrall ♦ Eyes of the Dark: Darkness ♦ Flame Blade ♦ Gust of Wind ♦ Heat Metal ♦ Hold Person ♦ Invisibility ♦ Knock ♦ Lesser Restoration ♦ Magic Weapon ♦ Melf's Acid Arrow ♦ Mirror Image ♦ Misty Step ♦ Moonbeam ♦ Pass without Trace ♦ Phantasmal Force ♦ Prayer of Healing ♦ Protection from Poison ♦ Ray of Enfeeblement ♦ Scorching Ray ♦ See Invisibility ♦ Shadow Blade (Spell) ♦ Shatter ♦ Silence ♦ Spike Growth ♦ Spiritual Weapon ♦ Web ♦ Whossa Large Fellow ♦ Zephyr Break",
