Aid the Underduke can be acquired during Act 3. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earning more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nAid the Underduke Objectives\n\nVisit the Guildhall\n\nWe overheard some gossip at Sharess' Caress. Nine Fingers, leader of the city's criminal Guild, is having her territory threatened by a new player on the scene: The Stone Lord. We should head to the Guildhall to find out more.\n\nHelp Jaheira find Minsc\n\nSearch for the Stone Lord\n\nFind the Stone Lord at Counting House\n\nTwo drunken Guild members let slip that Nine-Fingers plans to ambush the Stone Lord at the city's Counting House. We need to get there first if we want to save. We found a note indicating that Nine-Figers plans to ambush the Stone Lord at the city's Counting House. We need to get there first if we want to save him.\n\nFind the Stone Lord in the Sewers\n\nReturn to the Guildhall\n\nAid the Underduke Walkthrough\n\nWhile exploring Rivington, you find a group of guild men fighting Stonelord's men at the riverbank (X:-212, Y:87), you can pick a side or stay neutral. But there's an undercover harper in the team guild and you can find tadpoles on Stonelord's men (X-215, Y132), which makes helping the guild more rewarding. More tadpoles can be found in the central storage on the boat (X:-214, Y:131) and in a barrel (X:-255, Y:107). (Which side you pick makes no impact on the quest.) At Sharess' Caress, you can overhear two drunken men talking about Nine-fingers (Perception DC 15). You can then persuade them to talk more about the guide. Next, visit Guildhall at Lower City of Baldur's Gate, you can find the entrance at (X61, Y-99). You can open the entrance by lockpicking (DC 20), if you have Jaheira on the team, select \"Careful, that's the High Harper Jaheira you're speaking to\" grants you access. Or, you can use Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation skills. (Alternatively, collect the 'Guild Ring' from the house opposite the entrance (it's in a chest). Insert it into the wall slot to reveal the entrance.) Talk to Nine-Fingers in her office and learn that she has laid a trap to deal with that Stonelord, but won't tell you the details. Luckily 2 drunken guild members let slip that Nine-Fingers plans to ambush Minsc at City's Counting House. You can also find the details of the plan from Uktar (near X-30, Y754) by choosing \"The Quicker I deal with the Stone Lord, the quicker Nine-Fingers gets back to business\". The note in Keene's room also gives away her plan. Travel to the Counting House Bank, and ask Head Clerk Meadhoney to permit you to enter the vault. (You can use Persuasion, Intimidation, Deception skills or by having Jaheira with you.) You can find the bank pass and the code by sneaking upstairs, the pass can be found on a side table in the corner of the first room (X-103, Y-185), the code (1356) to the High-security vault is hidden in a book in the second room. There is plenty of loot in the Counting House Vault, you can use Dimensional door/Fly/Jump to get them. When you reach the end of the Vault, use Water + Lightning to disable the gate to the lower level. Or you can use the code (1356) hidden in a book on the second floor. You find Minsc robbing the vault along with some Bhaalist Shapeshifters. Defeat the Bhaalists, on one of the Bhaalists, you will find the note mentioning Minsc's hideout is in the Sewers. (Succeed in perception checks and you can find the muddy footprints in the Vault, which also leads to the sewer.) Talk to Rakath gives you a side quest Return Rakath's Gold. Before you leave the vault, don't forget to loot the safes, there's a tadpole specimen in High-security safe No.6 Now head to the city sewer, you can find Bhaalists in Abandoned Cistern (Accessed from northwest of City Sewers, near X-254, Y875). Jump on the pipes to reach an area with a Sluice Valve, unstuck it by passing an athletic check or interact with water level valve and temperature valve to open the door. In the Keep Out room, have your teammates stand on the pressure plates to enter a secret area. Once you find Minsc, use non-lethal attacks to knock him out. If Jaheira is alive, you can recruit Minsc to your team. Return to the Guildhall and defeat the Zhentarim. Nine-Finger will join you in Gather Your Allies. (If Roah or Friol is still alive, you can side with Zhentarim and attack the Guild. Both Nine-Fingers and Zhentarim can be your allies in Gather Your Allies.)\n\nHow to unlock Aid the Underduke\n\nNine-Fingers, Guildhall\n\nAid the Underduke Rewards\n\nAid the Underduke Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
