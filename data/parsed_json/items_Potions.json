  "content": "Potions in Baldur's Gate 3 are consumables used to replenish a variety of elements in the game and to gain temporary buffs. These can be found in various ways such as enemy or boss drops, scattered in various locations, inside crates/chests, and are sold by Merchants.\n\nTips: Most Potions can work if you simply throw it on other characters. For example, if you throw a Potion of Healing on a companion, then he or she will be healed. Works better if you stick your team members together and use one potion to cure the entire team.\n\n(Simply throw potions on the ground to use it on multiple companions.)\n\n(You can unlink teammates and order them to move to the same spot.)\n\n(Characters will stand together so one option can work on all party members.)\n\nPotions Information\n\nBALDUR'S GATE 3 POTIONS COMPARISON TABLE\n\nYou can search by Name, Effect or Description.
