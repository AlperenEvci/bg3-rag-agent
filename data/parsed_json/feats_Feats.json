  "content": "Feats in Baldur's Gate 3 are special talents or areas of expertise that provide special capabilities to characters. Each Feat is unique, giving you an extra passive or active skill that you would not have gotten otherwise through your chosen Class or Backgrounds. These Feats can range from increases in Ability Scores, to proficiencies that give you an edge in battle, to skill bonuses that are best suited for out-of-combat scenarios. Feats can help cover up any weaknesses your character may have, or bolster features of your character to make them even more powerful.\n\nYou can only take each Feat once unless the Feat’s description says otherwise, for example, Elemental Adept.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Feats Overview\n\nHow to Obtain More Feats in BG3\n\nEach class gains the Ability Score Improvement feature at certain levels. These levels are Level 4, Level 8, and Level 12. Through this feature, you can increase an Ability score of your choice by 2, or any two ability scores by 1 to a maximum score of 20.\n\nHowever, using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking the Ability Score Improvement feature to take a Feat of your choice instead, i.e. instead of increasing your stats, you can choose to take a new Feat. As such, the maximum number of Feats you can have at the maximum level of 12 in Baldur's Gate 3 is three.\n\nBG3 Builds - Everything You Should Know\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Feat Prerequisites\n\nYou can take any Feat regardless of your Class or Race, so long as you meet its required prerequisite. If you ever lose a Feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that Feat until you regain the prerequisite. An example the game and the Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook gives is regarding the Grappler feat.\n\nThis Feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 by any means —perhaps by a withering curse— you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored back to the prerequisite of 13.\n\nBG3 Feats - Which Are the Best For Your Build\n\nBG3 Feats & Multiclassing\n\nAt every four levels of a class, you will gain a Feat. This means that if you are a single class, you'll gain a feat at level four, level eight, and level twelve. However, if you multi-class, the levels at which you gain feats will depend on how long it takes you to gain four levels of a class. This means that single-class characters will always gain three feats in Baldur's Gate 3, but multi-class characters, unless they multi-class every four levels or at eight levels and four levels, will only gain two feats.\n\nFor instance, if they take something like seven levels of Paladin and five levels of Warlock, they would only gain two feats. So, they lose out a little bit unless they hit these exact breakpoints of eight and four or four, four, and four.\n\nAll Feats in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nYou can search by Name, Requirement, or Effect.
