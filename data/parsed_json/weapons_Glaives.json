  "content": "Glaives in Baldur's Gate 3 are pieces of equipment that are used to inflict damage against hostile characters such as Enemies and Bosses. Glaives are Two-Handed Martial Weapons in BG3 that boast Extra Reach. They can only be two-handed, dealing 1-10 damage without enchantments. They have a range of 2.5m, and deal Slashing Damage, though some special Glaives also deal another type of Damage as well. Being melee weapons, Glaives scale off of Strength, save for The Dancing Breeze which is a Finesse weapon and scales off of the wielder's highest stat between Strength and Dexterity.\n\nMany Glaives have unique properties, so you should read carefully what these do, and many also have Weapon Actions that can only be used if you are Proficient with Glaives in BG3. These Weapon Actions are Lacerate, Rush Attack, and Brace (Melee).\n\nBattleaxes Clubs Daggers Darts Flails Glaives Greataxes Greatclubs Greatswords Halberds Handaxes Hand Crossbows Heavy Crossbows Javelins Light Crossbows Light Hammers Longbows Longswords Maces Mauls Morningstars Pikes Quarterstaves Rapiers Scimitars Shortbows Shortswords Sickles Spears Tridents Warhammers\n\nAll Glaives in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nName Damage Special Properties Weapon Actions Glaive 1d10 Slashing None Brace (Melee)Rush AttackLacerate Glaive +1 1d10 +1 Slashing Weapon Enchantment +1 Brace (Melee)Rush AttackLacerate Drakethroat Glaive 1d10 +2 Slashing Weapon Enchantment +2 Vicious Dragon Breath: Enemies have Disadvantage on Saving Throws against your dragonborn breath weapon.
