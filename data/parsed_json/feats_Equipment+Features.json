  "content": "Equipment Features in Baldur's Gate 3, are the passive effects or conditions provided by wielding certain Equipment. The effects gained from equipment features are usually passive effects that will help you in combat. These effects don't require any kind of energy but they are only triggered by a certain condition required to happen. If two items provide the same effect, it may not be convenient to wield both if the provided effect has no way to stack. Some Common and Uncommon equipment may not provide any Equipment Features. Here you will find a list of the Equipment Features, provided by specified Equipment, and the effect description.\n\nHow to Get Equipment Features in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nAll the Features listed on this page refer to all the passive effects that can be obtained by wielding certain Equipment. The only means to obtain these passive effects is by wielding the corresponding item. However, there are some effects shared by multiple Equipment. For example, both the Adamantine Scimitar and Adamantine Mace grant the effect of Swift Hitter which affects your target with \"Reeling\" which will give them a -1 penalty to Attack Rolls for the remaining turn.\n\nWhat are Status Effects in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, Status Effects are either positive or negative affecting characters for a certain period of time or event. Positive effects are acquired by Characters through Skills and Equipment, while the negative ones come from enemy attacks. These effects will linger for a certain period of time or turn, or until after a short or long rest.\n\nChoosing an Equipment in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nIt is important for the player to choose the right equipment befitting their character, as this will significantly influence their character in combat. For example, characters that rely on Physical Attacks such as Dwarves with the Warhammer will have a great time with this Weapon type because of their racial feature that gives them Warhammer Proficiency. At the onset of the campaign, players will already have a wide array of weapons available to them that can help support their playstyle.\n\nWhere to get Equipment in BG3?\n\nTo obtain Equipment in BG3, these items are usually found in chests, bought from Merchants, rewarded by completing quests, or through crafting. For specific items, you may click on the names below to see how you can obtain the specific equipment, or visit the Equipment page for more details.\n\nEquipment Features in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nYou can search by Feature or Item Name.
