It is generally considered one of the most efficient spells to upcast and a very good way to start you day of adventuring. This health maximum isn't considered temporary hit points and stack with such sources, e.g. the Battle Master Rally. For any non-summon spell that lasts until Long Rest, the caster does not need to be in your party once you leave camp as long as the spell does not require concentration. Therefore, you can easily cast this spell on any party members you plan to use while leaving the caster back in camp. If the caster of this spell removes it from their prepared spells list, the spell's effect will end immediately. In D&D5e Aid is limited to 3 targets, in BG3 there's no such numerical limitation, so any pet or summon will also benefit.\n\nLvl 2 Spells Arcane Lock ♦ Barkskin ♦ Blindness ♦ Blur ♦ Branding Smite ♦ Calm Emotions ♦ Chromatic Orb: Acid (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Cold (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Fire (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Lightning (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Poison (Lvl 2) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Thunder (Lvl 2) ♦ Cloud of Daggers ♦ Crown of Madness ♦ Darkness ♦ Darkvision ♦ Detect Thoughts ♦ Enhance Ability ♦ Enlarge - Reduce ♦ Enthrall ♦ Eyes of the Dark: Darkness ♦ Flame Blade ♦ Gust of Wind ♦ Heat Metal ♦ Hold Person ♦ Invisibility ♦ Knock ♦ Lesser Restoration ♦ Magic Weapon ♦ Melf's Acid Arrow ♦ Mirror Image ♦ Misty Step ♦ Moonbeam ♦ Pass without Trace ♦ Phantasmal Force ♦ Prayer of Healing ♦ Protection from Poison ♦ Ray of Enfeeblement ♦ Scorching Ray ♦ See Invisibility ♦ Shadow Blade (Spell) ♦ Shatter ♦ Silence ♦ Spike Growth ♦ Spiritual Weapon ♦ Warding Bond ♦ Web ♦ Whossa Large Fellow ♦ Zephyr Break",
