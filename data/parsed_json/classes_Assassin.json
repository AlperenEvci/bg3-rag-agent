At level 3, Assassins learn Assassinate: Initiative, which grants them Advantage on Attack Rolls against creatures that haven’t taken a turn yet. At level 3, Assassins learn Assassinate: Ambush, which make any successful Attack Roll against a Surprised creature a Critical Hit. At level 3, Assassins learn Assassin's Alacrity, which immediately restores Actions and bonus actions at the start of combat. Making Assassins always ready for a fight. Gloves of Missile Snaring are a good defensive piece of equipment Rogues can equip. They possess the ability to reduce damage from ranging attacks by 1d10 + the Rogue's Dexterity Modifier. Elegant Studded Leather grants +2 to Initiative rolls, granting Assassins the chance to exploit their early-combat burst damage as soon as possible.\n\nClasses and Subclasses Arcane Trickster ♦ Archfey ♦ Barbarian ♦ Bard ♦ Battle Master ♦ Beast Master ♦ Berserker ♦ Circle of Spores ♦ Circle of the Land ♦ Circle of the Moon ♦ Circle of the Spores ♦ Cleric ♦ College of Lore ♦ College of Swords ♦ College of Valour ♦ Conjuration School ♦ Divination School ♦ Draconic Bloodline ♦ Druid ♦ Eldritch Knight ♦ Enchantment School ♦ Fighter ♦ Gloom Stalker ♦ Hunter ♦ Illusion School ♦ Knowledge Domain ♦ Life Domain ♦ Light Domain ♦ Monk ♦ Nature Domain ♦ Necromancy School ♦ Oath of the Ancients ♦ Oath of Vengeance ♦ Oathbreaker ♦ Paladin ♦ Path of the Giant ♦ Ranger ♦ Rogue ♦ Sorcerer ♦ Storm Sorcery ♦ Tempest Domain ♦ The Fiend ♦ The Great Old One ♦ Thief ♦ Transmutation School ♦ Trickery Domain ♦ War Domain ♦ Warlock ♦ Way of Shadow ♦ Wild Magic ♦ Wild Magic (Barbarian) ♦ Wizard",
