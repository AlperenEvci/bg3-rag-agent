  "content": "Patch Notes for Baldur's Gate 3 features an overview of all the patches released by the developer Larian Studios. The following patches are free and are released via online update, these patches focus on game balance, performance and localization issues.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Patch Notes\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Patch 8\n\nRelease Date: April 15, 2025 Platforms: All platforms\n\nSteam Trading Cards\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 now supports Steam Trading Cards! And you thought you’d never get them.\n\nCollect the unique trading cards to craft badges, and unlock exclusive profile backgrounds and emoticons to use anywhere on Steam!\n\nPlayers on PC, Mac, Xbox, and PlayStation 5 will now all be able to enjoy Baldur’s Gate 3 multiplayer, with full cross-platform progression and cross-play.\n\nUsing the Larian Network, you can now join and create cross-play lobbies to take on your adventures together.\n\nCross-Play & Mods\n\nYou’ll be able to continue to enjoy creating chaos with mods in cross-play, but it’s important to note that all players joining the lobby must have the same version of mods installed. When joining a host’s game, you’ll be prompted with the Mod Verification window to enable, upgrade, downgrade, or install any missing mods.\n\nIf you are a PC player creating a cross-play lobby, keep in mind you can use the “Available on Console & Mac” tag to browse mods that will be compatible with consoles and Mac, and that the mod limit on consoles is 100. Third-party mods cannot be used on consoles.\n\nUsing Cross-Play\n\nHow to join another player in multiplayer via cross-play:\n\nOn the main menu, select “Multiplayer”. Select the “Cross-Play” tab. Join the other player’s lobby. If you or the host are using mods and there are any discrepancies, the Mod Verification window will open to inform you of which mods need installing, uninstalling, or updating.\n\nHow to create a cross-play multiplayer lobby:\n\nAccess multiplayer. Select “Cross-Play”. Select “Create”. Customise your options and select “Launch”.\n\nPosition and pose your party, play around with camera settings, and whack a few stickers on there. Photo Mode is now yours to explore with Patch 8!\n\nTo test out Photo Mode, toggle it on or off by pressing down on both analog sticks if on console, or by pressing F9 if on PC. You can also enable Photo Mode by clicking on the Photo Mode icon on the HUD minimap.\n\nExploring Camera Settings\n\nWhen you’re adventuring with your party, you’ll be able to alter their positioning and try different facial expressions and poses, while making the most of the camera, lens, and scene settings, even during combat encounters.\n\nWhile you won’t be able to change the position of your party or camera angle during dialogues and cinematic scenes, you will still be able to enjoy a range of post-processing effects, including colour-grading settings, frames, and stickers.\n\nPhoto Mode & Modding\n\nSpeaking of stickers, Photo Mode already includes more than 300 stickers, but keen modders out there will be able to create and upload their own via the BG3 Toolkit!\n\nOne new subclass for each playable class is now available, featuring new abilities, animations, VFX, unique summons, powerful cantrips, and voiced dialogue for the Oathbreaker Knight for those playing as the Oath of the Crown Paladin subclass!\n\nPacked with new ways for you to play, whether you want to roleplay the God of Thunder by using Elemental Cleaver, imbuing your Path of the Giant Barbarian’s hammer with shocking damage and flinging it out for it to come back to you, or as a drunken monk, with truly homebrewed abilities that will enhance your next playthrough, there’s surely a subclass for you!\n\nPath of the Giant (Barbarian) College of Glamour (Bard) Death Domain (Cleric) Circle of Stars (Druid Arcane Archer (Fighter) Way of the Drunken Master (Monk) Oath of the Crown (Paladin) Swarmkeeper (Ranger) Swashbuckler (Rogue) Shadow Magic (Sorcerer) Hexblade (Warlock) Bladesinging (Wizard)\n\nUnlocking The New Subclasses\n\nEach new subclass can be selected once you have reached the level required to unlock it. This varies depending on your chosen class. Check out the table below to see when subclass selection becomes available for each class.\n\nLevel Class Level 1 Cleric, Sorcerer, Paladin, Warlock Level 2 Druid, Wizard Level 3 Barbarian, Bard, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 Modding\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit\n\nAs well as Patch 8, the Baldur’s Gate 3 Modding Toolkit is receiving an update, which means mod authors will now be able to explore partial level editing! Whether you fancy creating your own NPC, dropping a metric ton of carrots across every existing level just for the sake of it, pledging your undying love to Shadowheart by turning all wolves into bunny rabbits or by moving them to the House of Hope, you’ll now be able to use the Toolkit to add or override certain template types in existing levels.\n\nPartial level editing means that what you won’t be able to do with the official Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit is add dialogues or change the static parts of the world like buildings, scenery or terrain. You can, however, create your own interactive objects like a chest that teleports away every time you get close to it - no one will touch your belongings ever again! Including you. Or you could make a salami statue that you can put in your pocket. The world truly is yours.\n\nModding Guidelines Update\n\nTo support the new realm of possibilities with the latest Toolkit update, we have now updated the modding guidelines with new information, and will continue curating mods for console. As part of this update, we have reviewed technical requirements, and unfortunately, mods that introduce new playable races are unable to be curated for console. If you’re a mod author, we suggest giving the guidelines a read by clicking here.\n\nUI Functionality Improvements\n\nWe have been continuing to work closely with mod authors to ensure there are fewer conflicts between game mods and new patches, particularly for those that have ImpUI as a dependency. While the ImpUI mod isn’t currently being maintained, to help keep things running smoothly and to support the creative passion of those in the modding community, we’ve introduced minor changes to how some functionalities are handled in the Toolkit. Now, mod authors will be able to make changes directly for mods that rely on UI tweaks during Character Creation.\n\nThe changes now supported natively in the Toolkit include:\n\nAction Resources Racial spells at LevelUp Race passives UI scrolling for Heads, Passives, Equipment, Class, Subclass, and Origin selection Feat passives Radial customisation and descriptions\n\nThank you to Djmr for their incredible work on this mod and for keeping in contact with us while we resolved the conflicts and introduced this functionality, as well as Caites, both who have been particularly helpful, and whose names now lie firmly in the Baldur’s Gate 3 game credits, along with the mod authors who have been helping us test Toolkit functionality!\n\nAs Patch 8 begins to roll out, please remain patient and respectful of those in the community who put work into creating their mods. Some things might not work immediately after a new update and it might take a little while before a mod can be updated. If you can’t wait to dive in but are worried about your mod list, we recommend starting a new playthrough to enjoy the new subclasses and to try out photo mode.\n\nAlong with the new additions, Patch 8 also tackles a range of bugs, like fixing Shadowheart’s penchant for hair dye while skinny dipping, Cerys will stop getting involved in combats with Minthara from across the region, and we’ve resolved an issue with the moving platform in the Gauntlet of Shar that has accidentally proven harder to survive than, well, the actual Gauntlet of Shar.\n\nSPOILERS - Please bear in mind some of the entries below might contain spoilers, proceed at your own risk\n\nPhoto Mode 12 brand new subclasses – one for each class, including: Path of the Giant Barbarian, College of Glamour Bard, Death Domain Cleric, Circle of Stars Druid, Arcane Archer Fighter, Way of the Drunken Master Monk, Oath of the Crown Paladin, Swarmkeeper Ranger, Swashbuckler Rogue, Shadow Magic Sorcerer, Hexblade Warlock, and Bladesinging Wizard Cross-play Xbox Series S split screen\n\nFixed containers inside inventories not scattering their contents when they get destroyed, which could potentially lead to key quest items getting lost for good.

Improved server performance in the Adamantine Forge.\n\nScripting and Flow\n\nWith 12 new subclasses arriving in Patch 8, we’ve rechecked some achievements, including ensuring the armed version of Stunning Strike no longer counts as an unarmed attack for the Fists of Fury achievement, and its unarmed variant now does. Monks' Unarmed Strike bonus action now also correctly counts toward the Action Surge achievement.

Reminded Minthara that 'knocked out' does not mean 'dead', so she'll more reliably appear in Moonrise Towers. You can no longer teleport out of Moonrise while controlling Minthara unless you tell her to stay put. Minthara is now willing to talk to you after you tell her to wait in the torture chamber. Minthara no longer gets stuck babysitting Thaniel in Act II. Fixed an issue where you could talk about Art Cullagh as though he's alive even if he isn't.

You should no longer be able to ask Shadowheart about her Shar worship after recruiting her at the Goblin Camp if you don't know about her faith.

Mentioned the damage that Corrosive Spit deals in its condition tooltip. Updated the names of the condition tooltips for the Dilophosaurus wild shape's Corrosive Spray spell, adding 'Dissolving' and 'Dissolved' for clarity.

Fixed the 'No savegames available.' message showing up in the background while the game is loading the list of saved games on controller. Updated the credits to include developers who have worked on the game since release, playtesters, moderators, and Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit testers. Also updated the order of the voice actor credits to prioritise larger roles at the top. Fixed a bug causing an empty text-input panel to pop up and block gameplay. Fixed an '%%% Empty' passive feature appearing for rogues during Character Creation.

Fixed visual issues with the white translucent VFX that appears over portraits in the Party Line, caused when dragging one character's portrait over another's. Fixed the character tooltips that appear beside character portraits on the Party Line not showing up correctly on hover. Fixed a tooltip bug while trading where hovering over any equipped item would display a faulty tooltip, but trying a second time would magically fix it. The tooltips now populate correctly the first time around. Fixed a bug causing the sliders in the Gameplay options to autoscroll continuously when the left stick is flicked to the left or right. Fixed an issue causing the game to freeze for a second when switching between two characters with the Character Sheet open.

Updated Wild Strike so that it can work with the War Priest extra attack. The 'Fierce Perilous Stakes' Illithid Power can now only be targeted at allies, as specified in the tooltip. Fixed the Displace condition appearing on characters who didn't take Falling damage. Warden of Vitality can now be cast with Level 4, 5, and 6 spell slots (with no additional benefit).

Healing Vapours no longer immediately makes creatures Wet in addition to creating a Water surface. Freedom of Movement will now correctly preserve against Haunted Approach. Tavern Brawler works with Wild Shapes in Honour Mode again. Tiger's Bloodlust will no longer target items (like the bloody remains of already-dead creatures). Specified more accurately whether Wild-Shaped owlbear, dilophosaurus, and panther attacks are magical or non-magical, depending on the type of druid you are. Fixed a bug causing the upcasted version of Grasping Vine to cost an Action instead of a Bonus Action. The Forbidden Knowledge passive now works with Wisdom Skill Checks as well as Wisdom Saving Throws, as intended. Updated Mind Sanctuary and Grease to not target items through walls. Fixed Harper Skywin having Strength-based stats, which wasn't appropriate for her Dexterity-based build. Fixed an Undead Harper in the Shadow-Cursed Lands looking like Harper Skywin's identical twin. Nothing to see here, move along. Fixed some of the creatures summoned at higher levels missing the Hide action. Fixed Evasive Footwork only working against melee weapon attacks.

Glyph of Warding now works correctly with item effects, like those granted by the Spellsparkler, Mourning Frost, and Winter's Clutches. Fixed some issues with Uncanny Dodge: it will now trigger correctly, it will no longer trigger multiple times per round, and rogues can no longer somehow still use it even if they're Incapacitated. All Wildheart rages now give bonus damage to off-hand melee weapon attacks as intended. Wildheart rages should now also deal the improved damage past Level 9.

Fixed Black Gauntlets being able to target characters under Sanctuary with Phantasmal Killer. Gortash was overenthusiastically using Tyrant's Bindings, so we made him less eager about it when other actions would make more sense. Fixed a bug causing Gortash to react with Invoke the Black Hand every time he gets damaged.\n\nReminded enemy NPCs that it's okay to kill the unconscious party after they commit a crime. Fixed a bug where pressing the left bumper on controller during a dialogue or trade would open the Action Radial Menu in the background and make it seem like you were stuck in the dialogue or trade afterwards. Fixed a bug causing alchemy recipes to not unlock when you pick up the ingredients from within a container. The 'Summon Us' item is no longer tradeable. Fixed Jhannyl's Gloves not doing what they say on the tin. They'll now make the wearer cast Lesser Restoration to clear negative conditions. Fixed some instances of the party not being able to load into another region with no clear reason. Greater Invisibility stealth checks now get progressively harder in Honour Mode. Prevented Fast Travel - like going to camp via the hotbar - while on moving platforms like the cable car up by Rosymorn, which could cause your characters to plummet to their death in the interim. Fixed a potential soft-lock where using a melee attack on something in the environment that's too high to reach (like a wall turret or a dangling cocoon) could block your movement until the action was interrupted. Fixed an issue causing the Attack of Opportunity arrow to not be visible on Mac. Fixed reflected damage knocking out player characters when non-lethal damage is toggled on. Fixed an issue where you couldn't use Sneak Attack again on your next turn if the enemy before you in the Initiative Order was killed. Clients should now be able to join a multiplayer session while the host is snoring away during a Long Rest as long as there is a free avatar.

Fixed the screen turning black for several long seconds on multiplayer when a dialogue is interrupted by another player's action. You can no longer Long Rest while in the Astral Plane after meeting the Emperor. This led to the portal back to the Material Plane sometimes disappearing when you ended your Long Rest.

You now have to actually have a shovel in your inventory in order to start digging with it. You can now Dash with Actions and Bonus Actions with Ranger's Companions.

No more packing dead squirrels with goods. The Purple Worm Gullet now has an in-world item label. Fixed Shield, granted by the Amulet of the Harpers, not reacting to Magic Missile or reducing its damage to 0. Fixed certain Illithid Powers becoming unusable after you've been Polymorphed.

Fixed a data mismatch error appearing on the launcher in a case where it shouldn't. Fixed some lighting bugs on split screen related to how in-game light was showing up in cinematics and in different locations. Fixed an issue where when a local player would drop into the game, the lighting would fade in very slowly for them. This was apparent in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, which resulted in washed-out colours for a few seconds after joining. Prevented Movement from being consumed when you enter Turn-Based Mode on controller. Fixed a split screen bug where clouds wouldn't show up for Player 2. Fixed Lathander's Light resurrecting characters it shouldn't have resurrected. Added a check for when you suspend the game to buy the Deluxe Edition from the Xbox store during gameplay so that it detects it without you having to restart the game. Fixed the environmental fading system (that makes walls fade out so you can see through them, for instance) not working properly when loading a split screen savegame created while in Turn-Based Mode with the players on different floors. When playing on split screen, if the screen is merged and one player moves to a different terrain level, it would cause the ground to fade and appear invisible for the other player, making it hard to navigate. The game will now dynamically split the screen if both players are on different floors or there's enough of a terrain height difference between them. Fixed a bug where hurling a healing potion as a rogue in what is presumably an attempt to heal a target would trigger Sneak Attack and sometimes damage or even kill the target. Fixed a potential bug causing the class names in dialogue options being replaced with 'Rare' when loading a savegame. Fixed a bug causing targets of the Seeming spell to briefly appear naked or have invisible equipment. The Gloves of Battlemage's Power now correctly grant Arcane Acuity.\n\nFixed an issue in a particular corridor in the Crèche that could cause the camera to turn black when enabling Tactical View. Fixed an issue with NPC neutrality on the nautiloid at the start of the game, causing characters to sometimes turn hostile when they shouldn't. Alfira will now join in on your performance of the Deluxe Edition songs. Fixed a bug where interacting with the Ceremonial Battleaxe would cause the Guardian of Faith at Rosymorn Monastery to initiate combat with you even if you were way out of his range. Fixed a chasm in the cave beyond the Apothecary's Cellar that you couldn't shove NPCs down. Fixed a bug causing Fighters to appear unarmed when starting a new game. Tweaked the drop table for Derryth Bonecloak so she doesn't conveniently sell the Timmask Spores and Tongue of Madness you need for the 'Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite' quest.\n\nYou'll now need to deal with a healed Ketheric & Co. if you Long Rest during the assault on Moonrise. The passage of time heals all! You can no longer use Silence to keep the protective dome over Last Light from collapsing if Shadowheart kills Nightsong. You should no longer get stuck in combat on the roof of Moonrise Towers if there aren't any enemies left. Wild-Shaped druids are no longer instantly arrested by the army of the Absolute when following the road to Baldur's Gate from the Shadow-Cursed Lands.\n\nThose who own the Digital Deluxe game version will now find that we have fixed Kiam Goda's Kilat Drum not playing the Digital Deluxe songs like other Hand Drums. Fixed an issue with Shadowheart's parents that would cause them to sometimes turn hostile when they shouldn't. Added some fallback Countermeasures for the combat Atop the Netherbrain in case of modded subclasses. Fixed a bug where killing hostile NPCs in Wyrm's Rock with non-lethal attacks on would be too confusing for them and they'd become unresponsive. Steel Watchers can no longer get Drunk. Fixed newly-spawned Flaming Fists sometimes spawning with just the name 'Fist'. Fixed a missing screen fade when transitioning to the Upper City region on split screen. Fixed a flow issue in the epilogue letting you say 'My home is with Gale' to Jaheira even if you were never in a relationship with him.\n\nFLOW AND SCRIPTING\n\nFixed a bug where ignoring Gale and his mirror image at camp would lead to his double hanging around in the morning. Saved some players who were stuck sleeping at camp. Fixed some repeating overhead dialogues across the game to reduce combat log and audio spam. Fixed Gale's body not moving at all while he delivers a line about Voss. Jaheira no longer trades items at camp as though she's a merchant while she's still in the party - this led to strange interactions at camp. If you engaged in trade with her and left items on her, you can get them back by just taking them out of her inventory the normal way.Fixed an issue with the Shadowheart vs Lae'zel fight night where the defeated character could still survive the night and would hang around without being able to join the party. Fixed some cases where the night would literally never end (careful what you wish for) because a party member not in the active party was in a dialogue while everyone else was snoozin'. Fixed some characters who were stuck in Wild Shape form. Fixed a dialogue flow issue where asking Shadowheart about the fight with Lae'zel would make her talk about Astarion. Focus, Shadowheart. Fixed a case where the non-summoned version of Scratch had no dialogue at camp. Balance is restored. Fixed an issue where some of Shadowheart's incurable wound flare-ups would block later flare-ups, blocking off some later content. Fixed a bug where Origins that were resurrected for camp nights during region transitions and died outside of camp were not sent back to camp. Fixed Sceleritas sometimes referring to the Dark Urge using the wrong pronouns when talking to other party members. Also fixed him sometimes repeating his lines. Fixed companions talking about being in the swamp from Act I even if they're not. It's rude to call people's homes 'stinking swamps', Astarion. Gale should no longer tell you to join Elminster at camp if you're already at camp. You no longer need to interact with Nightsong and Isobel at the end of Act II to receive their Gather Your Allies ability. Fixed a voice line not being audible when the cursed monk possesses the corpse of Shirra Clarwen. Fixed some cases where the cursed monk inhabiting the amulet would fail to comment on certain areas while the amulet is equipped. Fixed the game displaying an empty Strength check in the dialogue that happens after you use Heal on the Dark Urge. Fixed a multiplayer issue where if one avatar had enough approval with a companion for a romantic scene to trigger but wasn't available for it, and none of the others had enough approval, the romantic scene would still trigger. Gale will no longer demand to eat your magical trinkets if you don't even have him recruited to the party. Minthara no longer insists on repeating herself about the Emperor's illithidity. Fixed a bug where being spotted by a guard while committing two crimes at the same time, with one crime being trespassing, could lead to a soft-lock. For example, a Wyrm's Rock prison guard could spot you in a forbidden area immediately after you destroyed the door leading to the main part of the prison.\n\nShadowheart should no longer bang on the chapel door while talking. That's manners. Fixed an issue where you wouldn't receive the locket from Arabella's parents after dealing with the Shadow Druids. Fixed a bug where approaching the goblins at the windmill with a non-avatar character would cause both avatar and companion to be addressed. This could unnecessarily cause combat to ensue. Fixed a bug causing Shadowheart to appear dead when loading older saves should she have been killed in the showdown with Lae'zel. This fix prevents the bug from happening in new playthroughs. Fixed a bug where if you killed Gekh, then used Glut's Animating Spores to resurrect him, then dismissed Glut, both Spore Servant Gekh and Glut could become hostile towards you. It would also cause Gekh to try to stop you from using the raft to cross the lake. Fixed multiple Oath of Vengeance dialogue options not appearing in Act I dialogues. Fixed a bug allowing Glut to travel outside the Underdark if you used a waypoint from within the camp. Back in your cave, Glut. Fixed an issue where Halsin would join the fight but not take his turn if you decided to fight Elminster at the camp in the Rosymorn region. Sceleritas will no longer refer to your artful handling of the poor bard's carotid artery if you didn't 'take care' of her yourself. In rare cases where the illusion concealing the true nature of the hag's servants is broken but the illusion concealing the general area is not, the dialogues will now reflect that. Interrupting Nere's dialogue after rescuing him from the cave-in should now correctly cause him to become - and remain - hostile when necessary. Fixed a bug where talking to Baelen for the first time while he's in the middle of picking up his backpack could cause him to not teleport beyond the bibberbang field. If this already happened to you, you'll need to talk to him again to make him go to the Myconid Village. He's forgetful, you see. Fixed the goblins from the Goblin Camp sometimes joining combat in the Emerald Grove when they shouldn't. Meli now actually pickpockets Barth. Removed a particular overhead line in the Adamantine Forge that suggested the hammer was just starting to move when it, in fact, had just stopped moving. The healing potion Auntie Ethel gives you in the Emerald Grove now correctly applies the healing effect. Fixed an issue where Sovereign Glut could join the party as follower after being killed and refuse to leave. Fixed a bug that was preventing Wyll from commenting on the fact Astarion held a blade to your throat during Astarion's recruitment dialogue by the beach. Halsin is a little more reliable when it comes to joining you at camp when he says he will. The sleeping bugbears in the Goblin Camp will now more consistently react to you choosing to attack them via the dialogue UI. Fixed Auntie Ethel's double sometimes appearing again after her death. Surprise! Lae'zel will no longer name-drop Ketheric before he's ever mentioned when you speak to her after meeting Voss at camp. Raised the attitudes of some characters from the Emerald Grove when Minthara is defeated. Sazza will now walk off near Priestess Gut when you save her by killing Minthara and her would-be executioner. Added a missing dialogue option to leave the dialogue with Bex and Danis a little earlier if their repulsively adorable chatter about getting a pet is too much for you. Fixed a multiplayer issue where instead of Lae'zel confronting the avatar that goes inside the cave in the Astral Prism, the game would incorrectly choose Lae'zel's avatar instead of her for the dialogue, resulting in a buggy dialogue between two avatars. Sazza will now follow another character if the character she was already following is dismissed to camp. The hag will no longer start her menacing speech if she spots someone in her lair while someone else is close enough that she won't be able to finish the speech due to combat triggering. Fixed a soft-lock where you could get stuck in the Enclave Library if you sent the Key of the Ancients to camp. Fixed a bug where unlocking the Emerald Grove Environs waypoint before triggering the cinematic at the front gate of the Emerald Grove would cause Memnon and Arka to forgo mourning Kanon. Fixed a duplicate dialogue option about the grove being nature's beating heart when talking to Halsin. Fixed a bug causing three of the goblins at the Goblin Camp to get stuck in front of the Collapsed Corridor instead of following all the other goblins to the Emerald Grove. Fixed a bug causing Sazza to get stuck cowering after battle is over.\n\nHostile Last Light Inn residents will now become neutral again when the hostility is caused by an erroneous reaction to Minthara. Added some fallbacks so you can still confront Oliver after destroying his Nightdome even if you and/or Oliver are Silenced. Shadowheart will no longer immediately turn hostile and act like you committed a crime in the Shadowfell if you tell her 'You want to fight? Fine.' While she's not afraid of a good brawl, she'll finish saying what she has to say first. Fixed a dialogue option specific to sorcerers in the conversation with Dolly Thrice causing the Moonlantern to not work. The Moonlantern crafted at Moonrise Towers will now protect you from the shadow curse as intended. Fixed an issue where attempting a skill check against Kar'niss could occasionally cause the dialogue to end abruptly. Fixed an issue causing avatar Origin characters in a party with a Dark Urge character to potentially turn hostile along with other companions during a Dark Urge event at night in Act II if the Dark Urge character fails to persuade them that they are not responsible for the murder. Also fixed avatars that were broken in this way, including dead avatars that can't be resurrected. Fixed an issue where a dead Shadowheart could still trigger a dialogue at camp with Nightsong. Fixed a rare bug where being arrested by the marching army when trying to get to Baldur's Gate for the second time could lead to player characters who were present during the first arrest, but not during the second arrest, to still be teleported into the prison cell in Moonrise Towers. Minthara will now continue to want to speak to you after you tell her to wait. Fixed an issue where sending Gortash's Netherstone-Studded Gauntlet directly to camp instead of picking it up wouldn't give you his Netherstone until you went back to the Traveller's Chest and retrieved the gauntletfrom it. Now sending the gauntlet to camp results in you getting his Netherstone immediately to prevent you from losing track of it. Minthara and Halsin will now more consistently choose to remain in the Shadow-Cursed Lands when you load into another region. Z'rell will no longer fail to do her duties - namely fighting back when she's attacked - when she's in her office. Characters at the bazaar at Moonrise Towers will no longer continuously catch unwelcome visitors and leave it up to the guards to determine who's welcome and who isn't. Fixed His Majesty and Thaniel sometimes becoming hostile under the wrong circumstances. The Harpers returning to Last Light after the ambush will now be appropriately hostile or friendly, depending on the state of the area. Fixed a bug where Halsin could trigger a trespassing crime from within Moonrise Towers even if he was outside. ixed a bug where the surviving Harper scouts could sometimes turn hostile at Last Light if their leader died fighting the drider. Fixed your character addressing Shadowheart after deciding Nightsong's fate when Shadowheart isn't there. Minthara's Speak With Dead dialogue options now make more sense if she dies in Act II before joining the party. A certain plaque in the Thorm Mausoleum now correctly mentions who the coffin belongs to. Party members will now comment on the area below Moonrise Towers if they fall through either entrance in the prison. Fixed one of Karlach's lines not playing when you talk to her when entering the Colony in Act II. Fixed the cutscene for deciphering one of the Engraved Githyanki Discs not triggering. Prevented Minthara from being replaced in her escape-from-Moonrise dialogue by an avatar or another character. Fixed a couple of flow issues in the dialogue between Lann Tarv and Karlach.\n\nFixed a dialogue flow that repeated multiple times in the Szarr Palace. Fixed companion Shadowheart not interjecting with Shar-related lines in an endgame dialogue. If you're playing as Karlach, you'll no longer miraculously come back to the Elfsong after burning out or going to Avernus after defeating the Netherbrain when you have multiple romantic partners. Fixed a bug causing you to get stuck in the Elfsong camp. Fixed a flow issue where if Halsin was your romance partner and you chose to go with him at the end of the game, during the epilogue he would act as though you didn't. Fixed a wrong check issue that would prevent Shadowheart from saving her parents if given the opportunity. Fixed a bug where Scratch could escape the kennels by the Sword Coast Couriers through the power of fetch. Look, a bug is a bug, okay? Fixed an issue where, on some older savegames, Kith'rak Voss would not be present in the Sewers in Act III. Fixed a rare case in which unconscious characters would get stuck in permanent combat with the turrets in Ramazith's Tower that would never kill the character, preventing the portal connected to the shop from opening again, which in turn cut off characters outside of the tower. Fixed a bug where Orin's version of the Netherstone dagger failed to swap to the player version of the dagger when you equipped it directly from her corpse in a specific circumstance. Fixed an issue where Flaming First Madigan could get stuck in an infinite dialogue loop, desperately trying to send you back to prison. Fixed a flow issue in the Investigate the Murders quest where some players had their quest log update to say they'd learnt the passphrase to enter Candlehallow's Tombstones even if they hadn't. We've reverted this quest step update so you can continue the quest as normal. You no longer need to manually progress with spacebar or mouse or by pressing 1 to continue through Karlach's scene in Avernus with Wyll. Fixed the cinematic where Minsc bursts out of a mimic not starting when you enter the vault shapeshifted. Fixed Minsc getting stuck in the Counting House vaults. Fixed a flow issue where if you were playing as Gale and you didn't become the God of Ambition, you could still find yourself looking and acting pretty godlike in the epilogue. Fixed an un-interactable Oskar recovering from unconsciousness after a Long Rest before Kerri's portrait is destroyed if his possessed condition was removed using the Protection from Evil and Good spell. Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause Zanner Toobin to just stand in the doorway to the Steel Watch Foundry if you walked out of the building while he was your follower. He will now always return to the office and wait for you to come back. Guess he likes it in there. Fixed a very rare bug where you could break up with your partner but still be unable to date Halsin. If Allandra concluded the funeral and returned to her office, the waveservants will no longer stop you if you want to finish the 'Avenge the Drowned' quest. Fixed a bug causing Ravengard to die when exiting Wyrm's Rock Fortress after loading a save in which he was broken in a very specific way. Note that if he had died as a result of this bug he will not be resurrected when loading this patch. If one of your companions is abducted by Orin with the Mysterious Artefact on them and then sacrificed at the altar, the artefact will now be returned to a party member. Lae'zel will now respond more appropriately after you kill Voss in the Sewers if she is loyal to Orpheus. Fixed the Emperor thinking you don't have all the Netherstones if one of them is in a camp chest. Fixed a few issues with Minsc greetings when talking to him after dealing with Gale and the Crown of Karsus, and after making a choice regarding Orpheus. Warning Cora Highberry about the wine if you have the Sage background will no longer incorrectly grant the 'Crossing's Namesake' Inspiration Point. Hope should now correctly acknowledge that Korrilla is alive, if she is, when you ask her what she'll do next. Fixed an issue preventing you from reporting to Lucretious that you've found a piece of Dribbles before you'd found every single one.Zevlor's follow-up scene at High Hall now plays correctly. Withers will no longer let you ask if you can dismiss your hirelings at High Hall, given that he doesn't actually offer that service in dangerous areas like that. The Emperor now joins the Gather Your Allies moment when your rousing speech doesn't ignite the fighting spirit you were expecting. Fixed an issue preventing Aelis Siryasius from speaking after you talk him out of fighting you. Fixed some rare cases where you could trigger the alarm at the House of Hope after you'd already left. If you meet Devella before solving Father's Lorgan murder in Rivington, when you come back after solving it, the dialogue option about being sent by Valeria will now be more appropriate. Fixed Halsin repeatedly bringing up Astarion's relationship with him in overhead dialogues under certain circumstances. Roger Highberry will no longer follow Cora's corpse to mourn in front of it if you move it outside the boundaries of the wine festival. This will prevent Roger from, for example, appearing at your camp if you move Cora's corpse to your Traveller's Chest. Fixed an overhead dialogue about Gale triggering even if he's not in the party. The courier informed us that he found a lost letter from the Grove that was meant to arrive at an important party. It's now been sent on its rightful way. The Steel Watchers at Baldur's Mouth no longer sometimes slack off on their security duties if you've killed Gortash. Minsc will no longer mention the Zhent taking over the Guildhall in the epilogue when Nine-Fingers is still in power. Silly Minsc seeing into alternate timelines. You'll no longer say you recognise the Armbrust family if you never met them. Added a quest reward for bringing the Zhent shipment to the Zhent at Guildhall. Carrion's heart will now properly teleport from Thrumbo's corpse to the basement of Philgrave's Mansion if the dialogue was triggered by dropping Thrumbo's body in front of Mystic Carrion. Fixed a rare issue that caused Dame Aylin to not join the fight with Lorroakan in Ramazith's Tower and then become uninteractable afterwards. Fixed some of the vampire spawn not reacting to you attacking them after Cazador dies. Fixed the Counting House's restricted area not responding to trespassing in some rare cases. Lae'zel will no longer have trouble deciding whether she recognises Avatar Astarion in some greetings if he's disguised. When talking to Jaheira about her Rite of the Timeless Body, you could tell her your race lived longer than hers, regardless of facts or logic. Now this only applies if your race does, canonically, live longer. You can now ask Barkeep Severn about Cheeky Nora after the Guildhall coup is resolved. There were two copies of Taming Hope: Part Two in the House of Hope. The second copy of that book has now rightfully been replaced with Taming Hope: Part Three. Fixed a rare case where Yurgir wouldn't appear in the House of Hope, which could lead to you not being able to leave the House of Hope after combat. In the cinematic with Beorn Wunterbrood at High Hall, Jaheira or Halsin will now speak up before Withers does when appropriate. Wyll's greeting after entering the city will now be more appropriate to your Attitude rating. If it's below 20, no more Mr Nice Guy. Gale should now have a slightly different response when faced with the endgame choice after Orpheus has been freed. Fixed the duel between Sir Penghyst and Lord Jeth triggering twice if you choose to attack them both via the dialogue. Other characters should no longer show up during Gale's contemplations about surviving the end of Act II after departing. If you accepted the runepowder bomb from Wulbren in Act III, Wyll would disapprove. Now, you can now gain Wyll’s approval if you refuse it. Ringmistress Lucretious may now join your fight against 'Dribbles' & Co. at the circus. Animal tamers at the circus should no longer open the beast cages before the clown joins the fight. The beasts used to just run away without their leader in combat. Fixed the abrupt transition between two sitting animations for Lord Shattershield's Bodyguard. Fixed a Perception check that could let you spot a key inside Crimson Draughts through the roof. In the Devil's Fee, you can now close the hatch by using the bust again. The bust itself will always be available for use. Fixed a bug blocking off a dialogue option in Halsin's epilogue dialogue about him being modest about his achievements. Fixed a bug preventing overhead dialogues from playing when throwing Boo. Behold! The last little cheeks you will ever see! Fixed a bug in the 'Find the Nightsong' quest causing Rolan to die after a Long Rest if Nightsong and Lorroakan are killed. Fixed a bug preventing your kuo-toa allies from showing up in the endgame.\n\nThe journal will now close the 'Free the Artist' quest after you defeat Kerri and will no longer will tell you to go get a portrait from Oskar if he and Jannath split up, since he won't make one in that case. Fixed the 'Avenge the Drowned' quest not closing correctly if Redhammer didn't initiate conversation with you after all the waveservants were defeated. Ensured that the 'Steal a Githyanki Egg' quest isn't left open in the journal if you pass a point of no return and can't return to the Crèche to complete it. 'Rescue the Druid Halsin' and its parent quest 'Find a Cure' now resolve properly once you load into the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Fixed the journal not updating when you ask Mystic Carrion for a cure for Oskar's possession. Fixed the journal not detecting whether you already have the Torch of Revocation when you learn its purpose. Fixed a bug causing Minthara to continue asking you to kill the tieflings even if they're all dead, blocking quest progression on the 'Raid the Emerald Grove' quest. Tweaked a journal update in the 'Raid the Emerald Grove' quest to avoid suggesting player involvement in cases where it wasn't possible.\n\nFixed the Mod Manager not being accessible after disconnecting a local player on Xbox. Made overall improvements to the Mod Verification window to improve user experience. Fixed the Next/Previous Mod button allowing you to cycle through the empty Mod Details pages of third-party mods. Updated the search filter options in the Mod Manager to ensure accuracy. Fixed mod thumbnails sometimes not showing up in the Mod Loading Order section of the Mod Manager. Fixed a bug in the Mod Manager where downloading a mod via the browser and then going to the Mod Details page wouldn't let you uninstall it via the 'Uninstall' button. Fixed a FileSystem error showing up and requiring you to close and reopen the game to update or uninstall mods used in the current game session. Fixed various issues with mod thumbnails, like pixellated images or inconsistencies between the thumbnails and the title photos. The Memory Used widget should now be more accurate on PS5 when uninstalling a mod. Fixed a bug causing some mods to get stuck loading at 25%. Enabling a mod in the Mod Details window will now give you visual feedback that its dependencies have also been enabled. Whenever you log into mod.io, you'll now automatically get subscribed to all your currently installed mods. Also fixed a bug where the UI wouldn't update from 'Installed' to 'Subscribed' when appropriate. Fixed a bug letting you access the Mod Manager on split-screen even if one of the players doesn't have the correct permissions on PlayStation 5.\n\nBALDUR’S GATE 3 TOOLKIT\n\nEnabled editing of existing levels for the following template types: Items, Characters and Triggers (add/override). Added an option to reuse the base game shaders when creating materials. Added limited support for importing existing mods. Added a TranslatedStringKey editor. You can now create/edit strings in your own mods, and view translated strings in dev mods for reference. Added 'reloadUI' and 'reloadLoca' debug commands. Added a label to show when the Material Editor is in read-only mode. Added localisation for certain fields in the Tag Editor. Items Editor no longer displays items that can't be picked up in the 'available items' list. Validation Errors should no longer disappear when switching between tabs inside the Project Settings window. Fixed TextureResources not importing correctly. Fixed inability to change a project back to its original name. Fixed an Exception Error due to the Dependency list not updating after renaming a project in that list. Fixed the horizontal scroll bar not adjusting to text width in the Story Editor. Fix a validation error when trying to restore previous mod name if the mod hasn't been saved after renaming. Fixed the 'Render Equipment Icons' process in the Toolkit sometimes causing a deadlock. If you override an item's parent value in the Stats Editor via the Sidebar, you'll now see the orange diamond icon, as expected, indicating that the value has been overridden. The Project Browser will no longer generate a crash dump if there was no crash and you closed the Project Browser window normally. Disabled the 'Save' button in the Project Settings window for modders while in developer mods. Fixed a bug that could get you stuck in a save-overwrite loop in Toolkit by moving the publishing of .paks to AppData/../Local Mods instead of the /Data folder. To prevent a crash, you can no longer input unsupported characters when renaming using the Rename/Move tool. Forced Effect Resources to be inside /Data/Public/Assets/Effects when using the Rename/Move tool so that they don't disappear from AllSpark when you rename them. Fixed a potential crash caused by the UUID Editor letting you save while in Game Mode. Fixed potential data corruption caused by saving tech names with whitespaces in them. Added the Patch 8 content that was missing from the Toolkit in the Stats Editor and UUID Editor. Added an option to automatically update mod dependencies to include GustavX. Moved the Photo Mode section in the Toolkit to where the other base components of the game are so that it can't be edited via the Stats Editor.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND OPTIONS\n\nThe game will now remember the changes made to the audio settings after you click the 'Reset' button. Improved the performance of Voice Chat during loading screens on console. When you agree to reset tutorial pop-ups during Character Creation, the tutorial pop-up setting in the options will now also get re-enabled. Fixed instances of 'Savegame Error 544' on PS5 when you have long, multibyte avatar and savegame names. The savegame name length is now limited according to the length of the avatar's character name. Fixed the 'Restore Defaults' button in the Difficulty settings not working when you access it while you're already in gameplay. Added a Terrain Texture Quality option to the Video options. Previously controlled by the Texture Quality option, this now controls the texture quality of all terrain. Changing the terrain texture quality doesn't require a game restart for the changes to apply. The terrain texture quality can also be modified on DirectX 11, where previously, terrain textures would always be loaded at the highest resolution. Fixed an issue where adjusting your Texture Quality would secretly reset the value to Ultra the next time you opened the game. The setting no longer has a mind of its own. Removed the outdated God Rays setting from the Video options, which is now effectively covered by the Fog Quality setting. Fixed a potential memory corruption issue when loading out of a level while a player character is being confronted for a crime. Fixed screen tearing on Vulkan when VSync is disabled or set to Triple Buffering. Optimised the performance of inventories, particularly with lots of items in them.

Items and characters in your inventory that you can't throw will now show up in the Throw menu but will appear disabled. Fixed the in-dialogue UI buttons overlapping the text on some screen ratios. Fixed the model of the Arcane Turret not being centred in its Examine panel. Fixed the Character Sheet tabs sometimes missing their background image and being slightly misaligned. Fixed particularly long NPC names in Japanese sometimes overlapping with gold values in the Trade UI. Fixed particularly long custom map marker names in Japanese exceeding the bounds of the textbox. Fixed some grid-like artefacts showing up on the character models in Character Creation when switching between them. Fixed the context menu sometimes displaying the context menu of the last container you interacted with. Fixed the wrong error message showing up in the main menu when activating split-screen after trying to create a multiplayer lobby without permissions. Fixed a bug on split-screen preventing you from selecting modifiers during an active roll in dialogue. Fixed the dice animation missing when quickloading a save made during an active roll in a dialogue. The Bhaalist Armour's Aura of Murder tooltip now displays the correct aura radius (3m).

Clarified that Pact Weapon and Hexed Weapon use Charisma as the modifier in their respective tooltips.\n\nIcons and Portraits\n\nUpdated the icon for the Shadow Blade to better match its visuals. Fixed the Reward UI sometimes not displaying the icon of the rewarded item. Fixed the wrong variant of the Barbarian class icon appearing in Character Creation. Fixed the Lesser Hellboar's portrait, which had a golden outline. Controller, Multiplayer, and Split Screen Fixed the wrong controller rumbling when updating the rumble settings with wo controllers plugged in. Added a 'Move To' option to the context menu on controller while in combat or Turn-Based Mode. Added a Forced Split Screen option on the Gameplay tab of the options menu for controller. Fixed the HDR Calibration preview not showing up correctly on controller or when switching to or from controller mode. Fixed a visual bug when active roll bonuses first fade in on controller. Fixed a couple of missing button prompts in the controller tutorials for Pickpocketing and Sneaking. Fixed an issue where if you reduced the number of slots in the multiplayer lobby and this caused a player using a secondary controller to be kicked (because they were assigned to one of the removed slots), that slot would become permanently unavailable and the UI wouldn't update properly either. Fixed a split screen bug where one player's open tooltip would close when the other player updated their selected item via the equipped items pop-up. Removed the voice chat UI for non-console games. Added player names to the main Multiplayer Settings UI on keyboard and mouse.

Fixed a split screen bug on Xbox where Player 2's in-game environment would reload when Player 1 entered the Level Up screen. Fixed the 'Sell' and 'Select' buttons in the Trade UI being mapped to the same button on controller when you open a container within a trade and try to multiselect items. The 'Sell' option is no longer available while you still have that container open. When you highlight a tooltip on controller, the outer border will now appear beneath the item's icon. Fixed a bug on split screen causing the inventory context menu on another player's item to get stuck temporarily. Fixed a bug where the in-game custom dice UI would require you to press controller buttons twice instead of once to navigate through them. Fixed a split screen bug where Player 1 would become invisible from Player 2's perspective if Player 2 disconnected from the session while in a cinematic. Fixed some overlapping button prompts on the Report UI in the Mod Manager.\n\nAdded a Memorial Portrait to the streets of Rivington.

Fixed some lopsided and upside-down chairs letting you sit on them anyway. Fixed a gap in the wall near the Verge of the Shadows. Fixed some terrain that was protruding from the ground in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Moved an unreachable Blue Dye in Carm's Garms. Fixed some black planes in the background of the first cinematic with Yurgir in the Gauntlet of Shar.

Removed a teeny tiny itty bitty untextured cube that was hiding beneath the bridge to Wyrm's Fortress.\n\nFixed some low-resolution textures on Flaming Fist outfits.

Fixed a rogue occluder in the Hollow, letting you see the waters beneath the earth at certain angles. Fixed Morgan's sleeves clipping through her gloves. Adjusted the Dark Justiciar Half-Plate for female characters, which, when worn without underwear underneath it, was letting the nips peek through. Gave Bunny and Blossom - two very much human children in the Lower City - clothes fit for humans. Without tail holes. Updated several boots that were making githyanki knees disappear when equipped. Updated the Teal Slimfit Outfit to correctly show a tiefling body instead of a human body when equipped by tieflings. The colors of the Strapped Choker Leather Ensemble should now display correctly after you switch from a visual with the same mesh but different colours. Fixed the colour of the Oath of Devotion's default tunic. It was appearing ruddy red instead of the intended blue. Fixed the glass around one of the lamps in the Arcane Tower not aligning properly with the light itself. Fixed the back of some posters in the sewers' Abandoned Cistern missing their texture. Adjusted Eye Make Up Style 7 so the colour no longer also appears on the character's neck. Adjusted the icon and loot item of the Shade-Slayer Cloak to reflect the model used when it's worn. Adjusted the Adamantine Scale Mail armour on female dwarves so it better hides the chesticles. Fixed some clipping on Boris and Jacob, the skeletons at the circus.

The panel that opens to 'Donate' magic items to Gale will now also show items in your Traveller's Chest. It also now indicates which items are currently equipped. We noticed some of you hiccoughing bubbles, so the action for washing yourself with soap and sponges is now called 'Use' instead of 'Consume'.

The help that the Gondians promised for the final battle will now arrive in the form of a friendly Steel Watcher. Apologies from Zanner Toobin for the delay. The hair colour options in Character Creation will now remain accessible after you choose the bald hairstyle, so that you can continue fiddling around with eyebrow colours.

This means that there will be more banter among player characters in multiplayer games. Group Hide will no longer affect summons that aren't linked to the group in the Party Line. Changed the behaviour for selecting camp supplies for a Long Rest. When selecting camp supplies that are stacked, the game now only takes what it needs from the stack. You can no longer cheese the Leap of Faith trial at the Gauntlet of Shar by just clicking the final platform and letting your character pathfind their way there. Shar threatened to smite us if we didn't fix this one. Fixed a bug where resurrecting Lae'zel on the beach in Act I would cause her to appear in the Party Line but not in the world, preventing you from leaving Act I. Patched up some savegames where Gale still had his Necrotic Aura when he shouldn't on load. Fixed Minthara's body sometimes turning invisible on the Level Up screen. (We sorta liked the floating-head-and-hands look, but hey.)\n\nAstarion now has idle animations at camp that aren't just him reading a book.

Polished the appearance of neck kisses in lovey-dovey scenes with Shadowheart on the Sharran path for characters with large body types and dragonborn characters.\n\nWriting and Flow\n\nDotted some dialogue options and voiced lines into a handful of dialogues across the game, particularly to account for edge-case flows. These changes are described in more detail in the main patch notes below. Added three new Narrator lines for Dark Urge characters to add a bit more reactivity across the game. These additions are described in more detail in the main patch notes below. Resolved an issue that had been rendering some romance party banters inaccessible while adventuring. Fixed a flow issue where Avatar Lae'zel did not have the option to leave and ascend or stay on Faerûn after the Netherbrain is defeated. Added a dialogue option asking for a kiss in more paths of Wyll's epilogue dialogue. If you're in holographic form in the epilogue, Wyll won't automatically assume he's talking to Lae'zel. A bug that had been preventing Wyll’s romance greeting from triggering has now been fixed, so players in Act III who have a stable, loving, and committed relationship with Wyll will now see his romance greeting triggering correctly. Fixed priorities on Wyll’s greetings so that low approval greetings will now trigger accordingly for players with low approval. Companions should now be more sympathetic to Astarion fleeing from the sun. Added a new dialogue in which Karlach will react to Dammon if she finds him dead after he told her that he can help her. In Act II, Minthara will now react to you having knocked her out in Act I.\n\nFixed several issues (related to resurrecting characters via Withers, restructuring the party at night, and automatic camp night scenes) that would trap you in an eternal slumber, unable to end a Long Rest. Fixed a bug causing Shadowheart to keep repeating one line when you talk to her after she's resurrected by Withers from the Shadowfell.

Fixed the rune tablets on the nautiloid sometimes not triggering the Narrator's lines. Clerics of Lathander should now recognise his symbol on a Lathanderian amulet. Ensured the avatar is prioritised as the main speaker in dialogues related to the hag's Act I surrender. Minthara does, in fact, now have something to say about Orin after you kill her. Made the romance scene at night with Wyll in Act III unskippable if it triggers to avoid accidentally skipping it and not being able to finish the romance arc. If Avatar Karlach and Wyll are partners and go to the Hells together, he'll now act accordingly during the epilogue. Fixed Karlach's scene in Avernus not playing if you decided to go with her when playing as Wyll. A bug has been fixed so that Wyll will now talk to his father if Ansur is defeated after the pact with Mizora is broken but Ravengard is saved from the Iron Throne despite this, to decide on his title. Lae'zel will now wait a little longer for you at the site of her recruitment if you tell her you'll be back. Improved Lae'zel's idle camp behaviours to align a bit better with the other companions'. Fixed the fade-to-black after Karlach's scene in Avernus at the end of the game, which would give you a very brief glimpse of Game Developer Land. Breaking up with Karlach by speaking with another companion you're dating the morning after her romance scene won't block her dialogue anymore. Reinstated Gale's last line in his detailed explanation of ceremorphosis and tweaked a dialogue option to react to it. Now that you can give Gale magic items from the Traveller's Chest, he will leave again if you refuse to do so. Patched up some savegames that had a bug that would prevent the dialogue between Gale and Mystra at the end of the game from triggering. Fixed a bug that let you kiss Gale even if he was in a disguised form before confronting the Netherbrain.. Also fixed this dialogue with him cutting off before you could give him a smooch. Reworked the script that determines whether a character is too busy to talk. This will prevent bugs like Minthara's dialogue not triggering at Moonrise Towers after you rescue her, and knock-on effects as a result of this, like not being able to rest or fast travel.\n\nContinued to make performance and stability optimisations across the game and implemented many under-the-hood code fixes. Optimised performance. This will have a more noticeable impact in areas with large numbers of NPCs (like the Lower City) and will reduce peak memory usage when loading levels for the first time. It will also be noticeable when managing lots of loot (e.g. when transferring everything from a camp chest to a character's inventory).\n\nReworked and revamped the cutscene that plays when you interact with Ansur's bones in the Wyrmway. Polished facial expressions and emotions across companion dialogues, including to the facial animations of your character during some kissing cinematics, including with the Vampire Lord Astarion.\n\nCRASHES AND BLOCKERS\n\nFixed a crash when loading the Act I region. Fixed a crash when mousing over characters in combat. Fixed some issues with Long Rest: Loading a save made during a Long Rest could cause a crash and you could sometimes get stuck in a Long Rest forever and ever, amen. Fixed a potential crash when saving at the end of Act II. Fixed a potential crash on load. Fixed a potential crash on Level Up. Fixed a potential crash when approaching the Abandoned Refuge on a fresh save. Fixed a blocker related to Orin's dagger, which will now respawn near the altar if you hurled her into a chasm and a cultist picked it up before you did. (Because it's bound to her, it would zip back to her corpse in the chasm, lost forevermore.) Fixed a potential crash when trying to load into the Lower City. Fixed a crash when quickly pressing 'Connect' and 'Create' in the lobby browser on GOG. Fixed a potential crash when the game runs a check for whether you have the Deluxe Edition DLC. Fixed a potential crash when Player 2 leaves a split screen dialogue. Fixed some camera activation issues on split screen potentially causing a crash when Player 2 rejoins a game mid-cinematic. Fixed a potential crash caused by the Reeling condition getting stacked too high. Fixed a crash when dragging the portrait of a dismissed Minor Illusion summon over another party member's portrait. Fixed a bug where using the Mould Chamber in Grymforge while in combat would prevent you from moving. Fixed a potential crash in Felogyr's Fireworks on Avery's turn in combat. Fixed a potential crash due to the game script requesting combat from a character that isn't loaded into the region. Fixed a crash that could occur during the cutscene that triggers when you reach the Netherbrain. Fixed a potential crash when switching between keyboard and mouse and controller during a dice roll. Fixed a crash when attempting to reload a savegame or return to the main menu. Fixed a crash when choosing to 'Take All' from the Chest of the Mundane. Fixed a crash when the dialogue with Baelen Bonecloak was forcibly cut short while mousing over a dialogue option. Fixed an edge-case blocker preventing you from Long Resting. Added a savegame error to prevent a potential crash. Fixed a bug where you could get locked in combat if your character was Downed but not dead when Isobel was killed. Fixed a bug where you could get locked in combat with Cazador if Astarion was alive and incapacitated in his ritual position, one of the other spawn was dead, and the rest of the party was defeated by Cazador. Now combat ends correctly with a Game Over screen. Fixed a potential crash when leaving the Iron Throne combat. Fixed a bug where you could get stuck under the elevator in the Colony, blocking progress. Fixed a crash that could occur when using fast travel in Rivington and Wyrm's Crossing. Fixed a crash that could occur when fighting mimics. Fixed a crash when dropping certain objects.\n\nCOMBAT AND BALANCE\n\nFixed a potential soft-lock where if you have multiple summons that are Surprised and you switch to a character whose turn it is on controller, the combat would get stuck passing turns between the summons. Fixed Form of Dread triggering a Saving Throw for Frightened if the character was already Frightened. Upcasts of Witch Bolt can no longer be used with Metamagic: Twinned Spell. Fixed a bug with the Goaded condition where if a summoned companion applied Goaded to an enemy, that enemy would attack the owner of the summon instead of the summon itself. Fixed some goblins missing the Fury of the Small passive in Tactician Mode. Dampen Elements will no longer require a Channel Divinity point. Improved monks' Deflect Missiles by helping the projectiles avoid obstacles on their way back to the target. Monks' Clench of the North Wind spell now targets up to 2 characters at Level 9. They just have to clench a little harder. Enemy NPCs can no longer use Dash again while the effect of a first Dash is active. The Saving Throw for the Dire Raven Companion's Bad Omen action is now a Wisdom Saving Throw and scales with the raven's level. Fungal Infestation can now be used as a Reaction when killing a target. The Spectator's Charm condition should now be broken through damage or by killing the Spectator. The druidic spells that Halsin gains for free can now be upcasted. Fixed Cloudkill not affecting characters at the edge of its range. Fixed Infernal Spears joining combat when dropped. Patched up some savegames that were stuck in combat where the game's script was not intentionally pausing them. Reduced the duration of the Shar's Darkness spell and the frequency with which NPCs choose to cast it. Swapping weapons between characters in combat now properly consumes an Action for both. Fixed the Meenlock Fear condition triggering a Constitution Saving Throw instead of a Wisdom Saving Throw. Fixed Auntie Ethel's Weird Magic Surge not triggering with Counterspell. Combat will now end correctly if you find that you're still in combat after speaking to the Emperor in the Astral Plane.\n\nFixed Nere's Coerced condition sometimes getting removed from characters despite them being temporarily allied to him due to his Wicked Coercion. Priestess Gut will no longer hit herself with her own conditions. Silly gob-gob. Fixed Mayrina and Auntie Ethel disguised as Mayrina having different HP values in Tactician Mode.\n\nFixed a bug where the combat at the Last Light lakeside would end and no further waves would spawn. Made the combat at the Last Light lakeside trigger more consistently even if you're standing in odd positions. Balthazar should no longer occasionally stand idle, causing combat to halt within the Colony. Balthazar's reanimated skeletons in the Shadowfell now have Shove only in Tactician Mode. Increased the HP that the Undead Nurses resurrect at from 25% to 45% during the combat with Malus Thorm in Tactician and Honour Mode. We've suggested to Yurgir that when he's invisible he should take advantage of it and actually try to move around a little so that he's harder to find. Improved the Thisobald Thorm combat in Honour Mode: Fixed his Legendary Action explosion hitting itself. Increased the damage and radius of his Legendary Action explosion. His Legendary Action explosion now applies a debuff based on the explosion type. Increased the damage of the buff given to his blighted allies. Blacked Out no longer applies Vulnerability to all damage in Honour Mode. Improved the Shadowed Spirit of the Land combat: His Shadow Friends will no longer disappear during combat as long as they're still controlled. His Shadow Friends will now disappear after his dome is destroyed. Improved the visuals for when his Shadow Friends disappear.\n\nFixed his Legendary Action explosion hitting itself. Increased the damage and radius of his Legendary Action explosion. His Legendary Action explosion now applies a debuff based on the explosion type. Increased the damage of the buff given to his blighted allies. Blacked Out no longer applies Vulnerability to all damage in Honour Mode.\n\nHis Shadow Friends will no longer disappear during combat as long as they're still controlled. His Shadow Friends will now disappear after his dome is destroyed. Improved the visuals for when his Shadow Friends disappear.\n\nCazador can now use his Legendary Action in his Mist Form. Ptaris now has Alert and Legendary Resistance in Tactician Mode. Rolan will now become more powerful after taking over Ramazith's Tower. Gortash's Avatar of Tyranny form is no longer dependent on whether it's his turn or not. Fixed multiple issues related to Gortash's turrets: Fixed Micromodron Force Curtain and Deranged Force Curtain becoming active even if they weren't in combat near Gortash and even though they can only target Gortash. Fixed the Grenade Impellers and Incineration Casters becoming active as soon as Gortash entered combat and leaving combat as soon as Gortash left, even if they were in a different area (Gortash in the Audience Hall, turrets in his office). They no longer depend on Gortash and become active or inactive when a combat nearby starts or ends. Fixed Micromodron Force Curtain and Deranged Force Curtain sometimes having two contradictory conditions (Active and Malfunctioning at the same time). Fixed a bug causing the Incineration Casters to be affected by the First Strikes combat penalty (causing them to skip their first turn) the first time they enter combat. Fixed two Incinerator Casters in Gortash's office not working correctly. Fixed the warning zone VFX of the Incinerator Casters not working properly and therefore not accurately representing the area of danger. Fixed an issue with the Incinerator Casters' warning zone VFX, causing the warning zone to be inaccurate. Made sure Ritual Drain is applied correctly on Asta, Yousen, and Violet in the combat with Cazador. After ascending, Cazador will no longer receive healing from Vampire Regeneration. Fixed a bug in Cazador's fight where it was possible to get more than 1 extra Bonus Action per turn for the same character by stepping on and off the pentagram in front of Astarion several times per turn. Improved the combat with Viconia: In line with its description, Viconia's Divine Intervention won't target followers of Shar anymore, even if they are enemies; and the illusory Mapped Terror forms will not change the character portraits. Lady Jannath and Oskar will no longer get Opportunity Attacks against the poltergeists in Jannath's Estate. The Moonlight Slivers' Banishing Smite will now stop myrmidons from empowering Lorroakan if the myrmidons are successfully Banished. Enemies in High Hall should now leave combat when Knocked Out. The second wave of Intellect Devourers at the Morphic Pool should now consistently join combat. Fixed Gortash's Legendary Action not working when Blinded. To improve her chances of survival, Hope now has a new passive called Last Hope that grants her Death Ward for free when she enters combat. During combat, Raphael will no longer care about walking on Fire or Hellfire surfaces. Improved the fight against Lorroakan: Elemental Retort now costs a Reaction to cast; targets will now roll a Dexterity Saving Throw against Elemental Retort; and myrmidons now also buff Lorroakan with additional Reactions. Tweaked several settings for the windows in Jannath's Estate to fix where combat can trigger. Fixed the Chult Alioramus not attacking you if you were wearing damage-reducing armour. Improved the Restore Soul spell so it's easier to reclaim a soul from Raphael. Also updated its visuals. Viconia now only receives Mortal Reminder as an additional passive in Tactician Mode. Added some lightning clouds to the final battle in the Wyrmway. In the fight against Dribbles at the circus, ranged attacks will now also crit against creatures with the Menaced condition. Fixed Krank not flying back up to higher floors in Ramazith's Tower. Ramazith's defences now include the internal turrets again. Also fixed the turrets' script so that they end their turn when they won't shoot, and don't shoot when it's not their turn. Fixed some technical names showing up for each of Ansur's limbs. Naming them all 'Ansur' was the ansur. Fixed Ansur's friendly Lightning Strike units sometimes attempting to attack the lightning strikes. Mystic Carrion's Legendary Action now triggers on hit, not when an Undead ally dies. His Legendary Action conditions are now curses, and his Legendary Action condition buff now heals Undead when it ticks out instead of when applied. Raphael can no longer steal souls from creatures that narratively don't have souls, such as Undead and Constructs. Viconia can now target Shadowheart with her trademark spells even if Shadowheart is Wild-Shaped. The enemy wolf summon in the combat near the sandy dock west of the South Span Checkpoint can no longer use Help and its summoner now has Hunter's Mark. Cazador's bats and werewolves are now immune to Ghastly Fumes, which his ghast-like Fallen Gur Hunters spawn each turn. Fixed a bug where, if Cazador is already dead and his spawn can fight back, killing a spawn during combat could restart the combat. Casting Dominate Person on Dolor before combat will no longer lead to all companions becoming enemies of the caster. Kled doesn't have Dror Ragzlin's Legendary Actions anymore. Dror's not one for sharing. Raphael's Infernal Salve spell will now only work on his allies who are also Fiends. The Wayward Undead condition will now get removed when combat ends, and the Undead entity will get destroyed when the condition is removed. The condition also now has an icon.\n\nFixed Micromodron Force Curtain and Deranged Force Curtain becoming active even if they weren't in combat near Gortash and even though they can only target Gortash. Fixed the Grenade Impellers and Incineration Casters becoming active as soon as Gortash entered combat and leaving combat as soon as Gortash left, even if they were in a different area (Gortash in the Audience Hall, turrets in his office). They no longer depend on Gortash and become active or inactive when a combat nearby starts or ends. Fixed Micromodron Force Curtain and Deranged Force Curtain sometimes having two contradictory conditions (Active and Malfunctioning at the same time). Fixed a bug causing the Incineration Casters to be affected by the First Strikes combat penalty (causing them to skip their first turn) the first time they enter combat. Fixed two Incinerator Casters in Gortash's office not working correctly. Fixed the warning zone VFX of the Incinerator Casters not working properly and therefore not accurately representing the area of danger. Fixed an issue with the Incinerator Casters' warning zone VFX, causing the warning zone to be inaccurate.\n\nImproved AI pathfinding around dangerous areas both in and out of combat. Fixed a bug where combining Wild Shape with the Seeming spell could let characters get reduced to 0 HP but remain alive. Fixed a rare issue where druids could not revert their Wild Shape when playing on a save with mods. Enemies will now properly drop loot when dying from having one of their ability scores reduced to 0. Fixed how the Chest of the Mundane handles item stacks higher than its maximum. (It should no longer gobble up your enormous coin stack and spit back a measly 21 cups in return.) Fixed a bug that prevented monks' Shadow Step from giving Advantage for rogues' Sneak Attack. Fixed an issue causing Tempest Domain clerics' Channel Divinity to not deal maximum damage for some spells like Shocking Grasp. You can no longer open locked containers through trade as if they weren't locked. Fixed a bug preventing you from looting mounds you dig up if you started a dialogue during the digging animation. Fixed some flickering shader artefacts that were appearing on, for example, Karlach's tent and Justiciar Crusaders in Umbral Form. Fixed some minor visual glitching between surfaces. Fixed items sometimes flickering when you approached them with the camera. Fixed the combat cursor on controller reappearing too soon after you cast a combat spell. Fixed surface lights only being created on split screen when Player 1's camera is nearby. Fixed dialogues sometimes not starting with characters who were pickpocketed. Fixed blocked or barricaded doors sometimes resulting in incorrect pathfinding. Fixed summons like cats not being able to squeeze through crevices and holes. Fixed druids being unable to unequip weapons after Long Resting while Wild-Shaped as myrmidons. Fixed a case where you could end up soft-locked after a Long Rest if a custom character spent the night outside the camp when they had a camp scene queued up. Dismissing a companion with Scratch's ball will no longer transfer the ball to Scratch after a Long Rest. Fixed a rare case where custom characters no longer followed the controlled player. Improved an edge-case quirk of AI spellcasting by ensuring that it has a source and target position before committing to a projectile-based attack. Prevented summons and followers like Glut from being able to consume Noblestalk. Yes, your Mage Hand probably ate it. No, we don't know where its mouth is. Dismissing hirelings or avatars via dialogue now functions the same way as dismissing companions. When Withers resurrects an avatar, the Dream Guardian will no longer immediately prompt another nearby avatar to loot them for a tadpole. Similarly, dead, dismissed avatars will no longer trigger this same prompt. Some decorum, please. When multiple characters in the party discover a trap or hidden item, only one will comment on it. We figured you don't need four people telling you to watch out for the same trap at the same time. Fixed an issue that allowed multiple party members to learn how to summon Shovel. Just the one Basket is enough, thanks. Made NPCs' overhead dialogues for certain crimes more fitting for the crime. NPCs will now react as though a crime was committed when they succeed on Saving Throws against hostile spells. Fade-ins and -outs now only occur after a crime combat when there is someone around to take you to prison. If you fail to lockpick a booby-trapped item, the trap will now trigger. If you succeed, the trap will not trigger and the trap will remain armed. Dismissing the leader of a party follower will now reassign that follower to an active avatar. You can now swap out party members by speaking to the companion you want to replace even if the one you want to replace them with is Wild-Shaped. What your companion will think of you replacing them with a sheep is another story. Lathander's Light will no longer be able to save companions that the Dark Urge was driven to kill. Summons will now disappear alongside their owners when you dismiss the latter to camp. Fixed multiple spots where Perception checks were being made through solid objects. The 'All Knowledge Is Worth Having' background goal will now only trigger after you read the last page of the Necromancy of Thay (instead of when you succeed the initial ability checks). Fungal Infestation can now be used without a corpse in areas with Rejuvenating Miasma. All myrmidons except Earth Myrmidons are now ethereal and cannot be thrown. Fixed some identical, stackable items not stacking. Fixed surfaces not being created if you press F5 in the same frame that they're created. Fixed a bug in multiplayer where using Withers to resurrect an avatar belonging to Player 2 could lead to the avatar being unable to rest or fast travel if, before the resurrection, the avatar was in a prison cell after being arrested. The illithid power Mind Sanctuary now consumes resources when consuming potions. Additionally, potions can be used within the Mind Sanctuary nexus if there is only one Action available. Fixed the Gibus of the Worshipful Servant not generating Momentum at the start of combat. Fixed a bug causing Dark Urge characters to get renamed after using the Magic Mirror. Elminster should no longer react to crimes that don't affect him. (We distracted him with some Stilton.) Fixed the position of pings for corpses. Fixed loading a savegame made during trade possibly not restoring the trade correctly and crashing. Fixed splitting not working in trade when moving items from your companions' inventories. Fixed the context menu not showing trade actions on items that are in a companion's inventory. Fixed cinematics looking broken on split screen if Player 2 disconnects from local co-op via the menu. Fixed ribcages stacking onto each other, causing items stored in them to be lost. Fixed an issue on multiplayer where Gale would briefly appear to be in his undies for the client if the host has the Donate UI open and Gale is wearing magical robes that he can consume. When you unlock a trapped item using its key, the trap will now be disarmed. Fixed a bug that would let you waltz your way through destructible walls without actually destroying them. (You could attempt to attack the wall and your character would pathfind right through it in search of a comfortable spot from which to take a swing.) Bald characters with the Wet condition will no longer have darker scalps. You can no longer loot the underwear of non-recruited companions when you knock them out. Fixed a username mixup on multiplayer where if a player was hosting a game via GOG and another player joined as a client via Steam, the latter's Larian Account username would appear where the host's username should. Fixed a split screen issue where Invisible characters would sometimes not render at all for a second player joining the game. We need them to be invisible, but not that invisible. Some Legendary Actions and other Reactions can now trigger from further away. Fixed a bug on controller where pressing the right stick to turn tooltips off would cause the A button ('More Details') to become unresponsive. Fixed a multiplayer bug causing characters to get stuck in dialogue if you swapped characters while in dialogue during an active roll. Fixed a bug where acquiring the Devil's Sight passive while standing in a cloud of Darkness didn't work until you moved out of the cloud. Fixed a small delay when playing spell animations.\n\nFixed the owlbear cub sometimes disappearing from camp when killing goblins in the Goblin Camp. When playing as the Dark Urge, if you invite her, Alfira will now actually join your party as a controllable character if there's room for her in your party setup. Temporarily, of course. Alfira no longer has a tadpole, can now be levelled up, and will no longer be able to use the Magic Mirror. Attacking the Zhent inside the Zhentarim Hideout will now more consistently drag your entire party into the fight. Shoving someone down the pit to the Underdark in the Whispering Depths will award XP more often. Soldiers will now be Inspired if you defeat the goblins attacking the Emerald Grove if there are no losses on the tieflings' side. Fixed the crucible at the Adamantine Forge becoming uninteractable after Grym dies. The 'Acolytes of the Demonweb Pits' background goal will now trigger if the spiders become Lolth's followers by succeeding any dialogue ability check, not just the Persuasion check. Throwing a fish at Tuffet, the sleepy bear at the Emerald Grove, will now properly remove it from your inventory. Fixed a bug where the Emerald Grove gate wouldn't open after the goblin raid. Fixed a split screen issue related to the Unstable Statue in the Shattered Sanctum causing player characters to disappear.\n\nThe Dark Urge should now be Inspired by killing Nightsong. Fixed a bug where your party members would very quickly change out of their armour and into their cosy camp clothes when you talked to them after having left the Astral Plane. We don't really blame them for being so desperate to hit the hay. Minthara now properly leaves the party when you tell her to go to Baldur's Gate alone.\n\nFixed a bug causing Omeluum to be unresponsive in the Iron Throne. Fixed the Wyrmway door not opening for characters behind it. Fixed a fading issue causing some background NPCs in the Lower City to have duplicates. Fixed an issue where resurrecting a mind-controlled Nightsong would cause enemies to become allied to you. During the final battle, backup companions being called upon with ally abilities will now appear with some clothes on for the occasion. Gale no longer has access to Netherese Orb Blast in the Netherbrain's Psyche. Hanged bodies in the Lower City (including Florrick) are less likely to fall down when you meddle with them. Only movement, a change in their type of death (like getting pulverised), or additional physical harm can take them off the gallows. Fixed the camera not following you when you get teleported to the Sorcerous Sundries entrance after interacting with the wrong portal. The smugglers' tunnels underneath the Open Hand Temple are now accessible from the cave-in entrance if you already came through them and cleared the cave-in from the inside. You can no longer use the Active Search feature to bypass the booby-trapped display case in Ramazith's Tower and pick up the key inside it. Smarty-pantses. A rat at Basilisk Gate will now come back after a Long Rest if you attacked it. Improved Lumbar support: Lumbar will now stand still after you paid him to hit him. Gortash's grenades should explode after being picked up now. Fixed a bug where interacting with the crate full of explosive toys in Rivington could cause you to get stuck in an endless loop of crime dialogues (being interrogated and sent to prison) and/or in combat with temporarily hostile NPCs. Crimson Mischief and Murderous Cut's Prey upon the Weak passive now works properly against enemies with 50% HP or below. Fixed several issues with the portrait that Oskar gives you. Principally, the image on the portrait will now be that of the active character claiming the reward, regardless of their position on the Party Line. Fixed a bug where dropping or selling certain items looted from the Lower City graveyard could cause NPCs to react as though you'd committed the crime of moving a corpse. Fixed the interaction between the Spell Savant Amulet with the Smite spells, Divine Smite, and Create Sorcery Points that caused the spell to always add one Sorcery Point when reequipping the amulet. Fixed Protection from Evil and Good not protecting from Incubus Charm. If you decide to turn Sorcerous Sundries into a battlefield, clients will now properly run away from the shop forever if there are no guards left to defend it. Fixed projection clerks in Sorcerous Sundries not disappearing in some rare cases if all combatants were killed, causing looping warning dialogues. Fixed Cordrane the Recent being able to raise a zombie in Sorcerous Sundries when he shouldn't be able to, like when he's dead or Silenced.\n\nFLOW AND SCRIPTING\n\nImproved the soundscape of crowded areas by reducing the number of background characters talking at one time. Fixed a bug where the entire party would stop following you, even if everyone was grouped in the Party Line. If you're prevented from going to camp, you'll no longer potentially be teleported outside of the current region when trying to flee combat. Interrupting Withers after asking him to resurrect someone by immediately talking to him again when the dialogue ends will now still resurrect the target instead of cancelling the request. Fixed a bug where player characters would fall into a chasm and become invisible. Fixed a bug where killing someone while they were walking to camp would stop camp night scenes from triggering. Fixed some edge-cases in which players could end up soft-locked in a camp night scene because a companion triggered the wrong dialogue. Now the game will select the right scenes for that night after the others finish. Attacking your companions as the Dark Urge after murdering one of them will now correctly lead to combat. Fixed the background goal 'Blueblood Solidarity' not completing after you talk to Wyll about him being the son of Duke Ravengard. Characters who lost the Necromancy of Thay after unlocking its secrets will see this book returned to their inventories. Minthara will no longer repeat herself when you try to recruit her with a full party. Fixed Florrick not joining combat in Acts I and II. Fixed your character speaking instead of Shadowheart when you sit beside her at camp in multiplayer. Shadowheart is now more engaged with the flora and fauna at camp. Fixed hirelings sometimes not having dialogue options. Lae'zel will no longer tell you not to give the egg to Lady Esther if the latter is already dead. Made characters' overhead dialogues for crimes triggered by the Banishment spell more contextually appropriate. Minthara now ceases to be a True Soul of the Absolute when she is recruited. Origin characters will no longer comment aggressively about Minthara's death. Fixed Lae'zel's main dialogue sometimes not ending correctly when you select the 'Leave.' option. Fixed an issue where the party with the goblins at camp in Act I could trigger even after Minthara had moved on to Moonrise Towers in Act II. A camp night scene with Shadowheart will no longer trigger if she's not in the party and, uh, also dead. Fixed Gale's 'splosion sometimes not showing correctly, meaning you'd get a Game Over without knowing why. Made further fixes to Us being in the party when it shouldn't be. Fixed your player character introducing themselves with the wrong name when talking to Mizora. Fixed certain camp night scenes not playing when you go to bed while Polymorphed (e.g. in Gaseous Form).\n\nTutorial and Act I\n\nFixed Avatar Lae'zel behaving like a companion at the end of the tutorial and telling you (or telling herself) to hurry. Fixed a bug preventing you from throwing or dropping the corpses of devils taken from the nautiloid. Lae'zel will no longer keep buffs like Bardic Inspiration and Longstrider after the tutorial. The hag will no longer react to spells cast while she's negotiating for her life with the Legendary Action she usually uses in response to spells in that combat. Kagha will now be imbibing if she's at the tiefling party. Mol will no longer repeatedly address you in the same way when you trespass in the tieflings' hideout. All the thieving little tieflings will now also leave the hideout when you anger them. You'll longer get stuck in an infinite trespassing loop with Mol after she asks you to leave calmly. You're now able to leave the tiefling hideout after Mol asks you why you're still around and Mol will run off when she warns you that you asked for whatever comes next. Fixed a bug preventing you from interacting with Alfira after you agreed to let her stay in your party. Shadowheart should now address you before running off if she dies before you go to the Emerald Grove and is then revived. Fixed a bug where Astarion wouldn't comment on being killed by the lance at Rosymorn Monastery after being resurrected if the resurrection happened outside of camp. Fixed a bug where picking up an Exsanguinated Boar and then looting it from within your inventory would soft-block the game. Only looting Exsanguinated Boars that aren't already in your inventory will trigger an investigation dialogue. Fixed an issue preventing you from talking to Nere before completing the quest to save him if his dialogue got interrupted after you sided with him against the duergar. Minthara will no longer ask you to eliminate non-existent tieflings in the Emerald Grove. Fixed a bug preventing you from interacting with Alfira after you invite her to join you at camp as the Dark Urge. Fixed Oskar Fevras acting like you'd never met if you talked to him after all his captors were killed after a previous dialogue with him had been interrupted while he was thanking you for purchasing his freedom, and if you talked to him after a previous dialogue with him had been interrupted by another player committing a crime. Zarys should now set off the explosives in the Zhentarim Hideout if you don't successfully negotiate with her. Fixed Abdirak's self-flagellation idle animation. Fixed visual issues with trying to save Alfira from being murdered if she's already at camp. Halsin's dead body will no longer join your camp in Act I after the camp celebration. Fixed a non-sequitur in Gribbo's dialogue at the Goblin Camp. Fixed a visual artefact on the fiery bridge at Grymforge. Also fixed creatures and objects immune to fire catching fire there. In the dialogue with the Ornate Mirror in the Apothecary's Cellar, fixed a re-rolling History check (regardless of success or failure) and fixed one of Avatar Lae'zel's lines never appearing. Ward Magmar and Ward Pistle, the duergar at Grymforge, will now make a snide remark if you're playing a small race. The gith in Créche Y'llek no longer attack you for simply getting too close to the door in the Inquisitor's Chamber. Now you actually have to leave for them to get angry. Shadowheart and Lae'zel will now have new equipment if it was taken during the nautiloid escape and they have travelled sufficiently far to realistically acquire it before getting recruited. The UI should no longer spoil the effects of Auntie Ethel's ingredients. Fixed a bug where agreeing to spend a night with Astarion in a conversation with him during the camp celebration and then deciding to sleep alone instead could still result in a romance scene with him. Fixed some cases where Grym wouldn't appear because the cinematic didn't work. Benryn will no longer follow you to camp or leave with you through a waypoint while you're in the process of escorting him out of the burning building at Waukeen's Rest. You'll now acknowledge that you know who Minthara is when talking to Sazza if you've spoken to Minthara before. Made sure your Wild Shape is dropped during the scene with Kagha, her snake, and Arabella. Zevlor's victory dialogue after defeating the goblins at the raid will no longer trigger if you're Invisible. Fixed Scratch getting stuck in older savegames if you celebrated at camp with the goblins. Fixed Korrilla being killable in the goblin camp prison after she kills Priestess Gut. This was causing her to spawn as a corpse later on in Act III.\n\nIf Isobel's room is Silenced while she's giving you your first explanation of the state of affairs in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, which prevented Marcus from attacking her, he will no longer return to finish the job while you're in the Shadowfell. The dialogue will also no longer suggest that he's about to appear. Karlach will now tell you her backstory if you reach the point of no return in the Shadow-Cursed Lands even if you didn't confront the paladins of Tyr. Fixed a bug where the imprisoned tieflings in Moonrise Towers would be saved and brought to Moonrise if you left the area while they were being rescued. Fixed a bug where Shadowheart did not receive the Spear of the Night when talking to Nightsong alone as a companion. Dark Urge characters will no longer get stuck ruminating on their past in front of Ketheric if they're disguised. Knocked Out Minthara will now always flee to Moonrise Towers. The Ketheric transformation cinematic in the Colony will now play even if no available player characters are in combat with him. Fixed a potential Initiative spam involving the skeletal involucres when player characters are invisible. Ketheric will no longer be fooled by distractions in the Colony. Fixed an issue that was causing Shadowheart to keep asking to retrieve the Spear of the Night at the entrance to the Shadowfell even when the Spear of the Night had already been acquired. The duergar at the lift in Grymforge will no longer warn you about the shadow curse and needing a Moonlantern if you've already used the lift to go from the Shadow-Cursed Lands back down to Grymforge. The goblins will now leave the Goblin Camp once Minthara has arrived at Moonrise Towers. Wulbren will now free the tieflings even if you're far away. Fixed Shadowheart getting a Narrator line not appropriate to her background when leaving the Shadow-Cursed Lands. If you fail to save the prisoners from Moonrise Towers and then gain audience with the Absolute, the prisoners will no longer be zombified and then killed and thrown into the Oubliette. They should now just be present in the Colony's Necrotic Laboratory. Fixed a secret button in the Tollhouse that was visible but uninteractable if you failed its Perception check. It no longer has a Perception check. Fixed the flow for Zevlor after saving him in the Colony. Combat interruptions will no longer prevent him from wanting to know about the other tieflings. Fixed an issue that forced you into picking a fight with Balthazar when you returned his mother dearest to him. Fixed an issue where attacking Jaheira at the entrance to Last Light would repeatedly trigger the same dialogue. Mizora will now call out in frustration while she's in her pod in the Mind Flayer Colony if she hasn't been spoken to yet. When the party is full, sending Jaheira to camp after the victory at Moonrise Towers will now actually send her to camp. Fixed Jaheira repeating some lines after the victory at Moonrise Towers. Improved the transition between Isobel's death and the start of the following cinematic at Last Light. Some repeating overhead dialogues in the Colony will no longer appear in the combat log to reduce log and audio spam. The Warden of Moonrise Towers now confiscates Minthara's Xyanyde mace and keeps it as evidence. Fixed the ghouls at Moonrise Towers bumping into a tower and sliding off instead of flying into it before they disappeared. Nightsong can no longer be Immune to being Soul Caged when she gets sent down into the Mind Flayer Colony. Fixed a bug where leaving the Shadowfell could resurrect an unrecruited Shadowheart and have her turn up at your camp anyway. She just liked the cut of your jib. Fixed a bug sometimes preventing you from resting or fast travelling after escaping from the Last Light prison. Minthara no longer lingers as a follower if she dies while trying to escape Moonrise Towers with you. Companions will once more comment on witnessing the Apostle of Myrkul. Fixed a bug related to breaking Wulbren et al. out of Moonrise Towers, where jumping back into the Oubliette would cause the prisoners to appear dead even if you saved them. Also fixed the journal indicating that Wulbren was both saved and killed. Ensured the avatar is prioritised for cinematics in relation to Ketheric's final death. Patched up savegames after Patch 6 where Ketheric's Netherstone disappeared after being stored in a ribcage.\n\nAct III and Epilogue\n\nIf you knock out Raphael with your final blow during his boss fight at the House of Hope, he will no longer stand back up again during the cinematic that follows, which would block quest progression. Fixed an issue preventing you from transforming with the Supreme Tadpole if you refused it the first time. Fixed some issues with the overhead dialogues between Scribe Goosequill, Baz Hopbank, and Fist Gummidge. Karlach's death scene no longer ends abruptly when a non-gith player chooses to leave with Lae'zel. Fixed a bug where, if you promised Cazador to bring Astarion to him and Astarion was in your party, you could go to Astarion at camp and tell him to replace himself in your party. Fixed some rare broken scripted character behaviours near the end of the game. Zanner Toobin will now trigger the self-destruct sequence correctly instead of suddenly forgetting he was supposed to be in a panic because of the Steel Watcher Titan. Fixed some repeated dialogue options when discussing Sorcerous Sundries with Gale. Elminster will no longer tell Gale to speak to Mystra in the Stormshore Tabernacle if you have already done so. Fixed an issue that caused Viconia to play the wrong dialogue when defeated. Told Devella to be more patient and wait until the end of the dialogue before she moves on to Basilisk Gate after being saved from Dolor. You can no longer ask Silfy in Wyrm's Crossing about Mol's location after already having visited Mol. When rescuing Minsc at the end of Jaheira's questline, the game will now default to selecting the character of whichever player is in control of Jaheira for the conversation, rather than whoever is nearest. This way, Jaheira will have a much higher chance of not only being included, but also interacting with the correct player. Fixed some duplicated books appearing in NPCs' inventories in the Lower City. Fixed an infinitely looping dialogue in Sorcerous Sundries. The entire basement of the Baldur's Mouth is now correctly considered a dangerous area. Jogged Nine-Fingers' foggy memory - she will now recognise you when you bring Jaheira to her after she asked you to. Removed a second letter from Tara's nest. Avatar Astarion will now correctly roll a passive Perception check to recognise the scar on Sebastian's face. Shadowheart no longer sometimes still thinks that Viconia is alive after having killed her. Poor thing. Sweet Stone Features, the condition granted by the Boney and Stoney statue, is now applied to the owner even if they are not part of the party and are waiting at camp. The Sweet Stone Features condition no longer gets cleared by the Bless condition. These conditions still do not stack. Karlach now will correctly react to Wyll becoming the Blade of Frontiers. Knocking out Minsc a second time after failing to save him will no longer kill him. Wulbren will no longer comment on Toobin's daughter being dead if Toobin is not present. Civilians talking to Carrion's zombies will now leave if said zombies either die or leave to Philgrave's Mansion. You can now return Mol's eyepatch to her when you find her in the Guildhall. Gave Sticky Dondo more lines to yell to sell his wares in the Guildhall. When Minsc meets Nine-Fingers after the Zhent coup, the skill checks will now affect Minsc instead of Nine-Fingers to match the narrative. Fixed player characters and the Narrator talking over each other when interacting with Minsc's relics in his hidden chamber. You can no longer open the barricaded doors at the Crimson Draughts apothecary from the inside. We forgot barricades are supposed to work both ways. Wulbren and Barcus will no longer clip into each other after the Steel Watch Foundry is destroyed. Failing to disarm the pedestal trap in the Archive in the House of Hope should now trigger the alarm. Yoinked Sceleritas Fel's hat back from Helsik's desk. If you choose to sacrifice Jaheira and Minsc to the Murder Tribunal, they will now die if they are defeated non-lethally. If you attack Sarevok on his way to the initiation ritual, the Echoes will no longer join him in combat if the door is still locked. Valeria's dialogue will play properly again if you kill Sarevok after beginning the initiation ritual. The members of the Murder Tribunal will now always become permanently hostile if you offend them. The Murder Tribunal will stop being a danger zone if you defeat everyone there. Jaheira will no longer discuss having met and talked to Gortash in Wyrm's Rock even if you killed him before talking to him. Mizora will now acknowledge that you've spoken to Gortash in older savegames. Made small improvements and tweaks to Karlach's main dialogue and her epilogue dialogue. Fixed the same dialogue option sometimes appearing twice when talking to Halsin about your adventures in Sharess' Caress. You should no longer potentially see the great empty void of Game Developer Land after starting the epilogue. Added more lines for Jaheira and Minsc to exclaim during the battle with the Stone Lord. Fixed a bug where it was possible to get stuck in a dialogue with the Emperor about killing Gortash if you clicked on Gortash's corpse with Karlach (which starts a dialogue, after which she leaves the party and goes to camp) while, with another character, you also clicked on Gortash's body and sent his gauntlet to Karlach via the context menu right before her dialogue ended and she left the party. Yep. You can read it again if you want. Fixed a rare issue preventing Ravengard from properly joining combat in the Iron Throne escape sequence. Fixed a flow issue at the end of the game where players with romantic partners would get a cinematic reserved for solo players. Devella will no longer disappear from Figaro's after killing Dolor under very specific conditions. On the Dark Urge's resist-Bhaal path, fixed a rare edgecase where Orin's Netherstone dagger did not appear on her. It should now appear in Orin's gore pile or near the temple altar. You can no longer summon Scratch in the epilogue using Find Familiar. This was preventing you from interacting with him. In the epilogue, Minsc should now account for the edgecase of Happy not being there. Fixed Scratch's spawn point in the Elfsong Tavern camp. If you fail a pickpocket attempt at High Hall, your allies will no longer become hostile towards you. We reminded them that the fate of the world lies in the balance and that you play a pretty big part in it, thief or not. Fixed Gortash's title potentially reverting back to 'Archduke Nominee' when reloading a savegame after the ceremony. Gale will now greet you more appropriately in the epilogue if you left Faerûn with Lae'zel and ended your relationship with him and he went back to Waterdeep. Improved the idle behaviours of Chef Marjoram and Sous-Chef Falura at Jannath's Estate. Wyll will no longer talk about hunting down Mizora when she's, like, right there.

Fixed the 'The Blade of Frontiers' quest not opening when you recruit him by replacing another companion. The 'Investigate the Beach' quest now closes after you complete 'Find Your Belongings'. Fixed the 'Free The Artist' quest not closing if Oskar was left in the Zhentarim Hideout. The journal update in the 'Unlock the Ancient Tome' quest that triggers after having read the Tharchiate Codex will now also trigger if Mystic Carrion or Tolna have revealed it to be important. You'll no longer get the journal update to look for the Tharchiate Codex once you enter the vault if you don't know it's relevant. Fixed an issue that caused the 'Find the Nightsong' quest to update in the wrong location. The 'Find the Nightsong' quest will now be listed in the journal under the correct region for the current step. The 'Embrace Your Potential' quest will now close if you choose to squelch the Astral-Touched Tadpole beneath your toes like a sentient little grape. The 'Daughter of Darkness' quest will now close properly when you surrender Shadowheart to Viconia. Sazza's quest now completes properly if you kill Minthara and her entourage. Fixed a bug where the 'Escape the Nautiloid' quest never closed on multiplayer if someone had already started a dialogue while everyone else was still waking up. Made it easier to open the 'Rescue the Grand Duke' quest. Fixed the 'Investigate Cazador's Palace' quest not closing in certain cases if you allowed Cazador to ascend and then defeated him. Defeating Ascended Cazador and dealing with the Gur people now closes the quest. Fixed a bug preventing the 'Steal the Sacred Idol' quest from closing when you leave Act I. Made it possible to finish Helsik's quest if you manage to steal the gauntlets from the House of Hope and avoid Raphael's wrath. The 'Free Lae'zel' quest will correctly update if Lae'zel is sent directly to camp during her recruitment scene in the cage. The quest will also correctly update if you open the cage after the tieflings are already defeated. Fixed a bug where the 'Get Help from Auntie Ethel' quest wouldn't close after you started a fight with her. Fixed the 'Rescue the Druid Halsin' quest sometimes not closing after he gives his briefing about Moonrise Towers. The 'Help the Hag Survivors' quest will now close properly if the hag is defeated. Fixed a journal update for the 'Find the Missing Boots' quest not triggering if you entered the Underdark, discussed the Underdark with your companions, and then left without reaching the Decrepit Village. Killing Cazador and then Ulma without Astarion in your party will now correctly close the 'Investigate Cazador's Palace' quest. Jaheira's journal could at times say she had something to talk to you about, but then she wouldn't discuss it. She's a bit less tight-lipped now, so you know what to do in the city.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND OPTIONS\n\nVideo Options: DLAA: Fixed an issue where enabling DLAA when FSR 2.0's 'Ultra Performance' was enabled would cause the output image to jitter and have incorrect colours. DLAA: Fixed an issue where enabling DLAA when the sharpness slider was set to a high value (>0.5) would cause the output image to be over-sharpened. Now, when DLAA is enabled, the sharpness slider and value are set to a safe default value that does not cause an over-sharpened image. DLSS & DLAA: Slightly improved performance when changing any DLSS- or DLAA-related settings.

Fixed a bug where the Reward UI let you select all optional rewards instead of the determined maximum amount. Fixed the Custom Mode banner (that shows up on the left with the Custom Mode artwork, name, and description on it) not showing up if you start a game in Custom Mode with the Honour Ruleset. Custom Mode savegames using the Honour Mode ruleset will now be named correctly (instead of suggesting they're pure Honour savegames). The Book Text Size option now also affects the font size in other readables like notes and scrolls. Fixed icons on the hotbar sometimes not greying out when they should. Auntie Ethel is now better at concealing her Polymorphed condition in Act III. Added NPCs' Saving Throw proficiencies to their Examine UI. Fixed the 'Equipped by' text on tooltips not always being the right colour (where white is the currently controlled character, blue is a character in your party, and purple is a character controlled by another player). Added a tutorial pop-up for rolling with disadvantage. Updated the icons in the Character Sheet for instrument visibility to more accurately reflect their function. Fixed the alchemy hotkey in the 'New Recipe' notification opening the character panel on the wrong tab. Text in the Spellbook about being able to change spells on Level Up now wraps to avoid it getting cut off, particularly in localised versions of the game. Fixed the encumbrance warning not showing on item tooltips when trying to equip items from other party members' inventories while already exceeding the carry limit. Fixed an issue where the save list would disappear when selecting another save file.

The Objective UI widget telling you to reach the Netherbrain will now be cleared if you reach the stem while in stealth mode.

Revamped the location label on the minimap to make it easier to know where you are. Updated the font in the game launcher.

Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the Party Line to disappear when you open the Transcribe Scroll to Spellbook UI. Also moved the position of your party's gold amount so it isn't shown twice. Pressing both controller triggers at the same time should now open the Shortcut Radial Menu and hide the Party Line. The 'More Details' button on the Examine panel will now work even if tooltips are disabled. Fixed the 'Place in World' function not always working properly. Buttons and the controller Party Line now only show during dialogue on hover or when there are dialogue options available.

Added icons to the Active Search UI to help easily detect containers and check what the target of the current action is. Fixed the Action radial menus displaying a spell cost for spells gained through feats. Fixed Action radial menus not auto-closing when using a throwable item. Fixed the portraits of corpses sometimes being misaligned. Added characters' titles beneath their names and above their health bar.

Updated the selector so it doesn't darken the content within the selector and the edge glows more obviously.

Equipped the missing pants on the Scale Mail outfit for male dragonborn characters. Added an icon for Hope's new passive, Last Hope. Fixed an issue with heterochromia on tieflings where setting the left eye to an elven or demonic colour with the right eye set to a regular colour would cause the left eye to glow incorrectly.
