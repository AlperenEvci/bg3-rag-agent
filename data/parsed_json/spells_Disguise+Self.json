Can be used to squeeze through cracks too narrow for a medium sized creature and gain access to some areas. If you still can't fit, try combine a small race with the Enlarge - Reduce spell to become tiny. Can be used in conjunction with Speak with Dead to fool a corpse you killed to speak with you. Can be used in conjunction with Friends to fool a merchant if you drop the disguise before the merchant can accuse you of having enchanted him or her. Can be used to unlock magical weapon bonuses tied to race, e.g. gain +1d4 Psychic damage with Soulbreaker Greatsword even if you're another race using Disguise Self: Githyanki. Bug: You can't use reactions while using Disguise Self. There's a mod on BG3 Nexus that adresses that issue however.\n\nLvl 1 Spells Animal Friendship ♦ Armour of Agathys ♦ Arms of Hadar ♦ Bane ♦ Bless ♦ Burning Hands ♦ Challenge to Duel ♦ Charm Person ♦ Chromatic Orb ♦ Chromatic Orb: Acid (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Cold (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Fire (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Lightning (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Poison (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Thunder (Lvl 1) ♦ Colour Spray ♦ Command (Halt) ♦ Compelled Duel ♦ Create or Destroy Water ♦ Create Water ♦ Cure Wounds ♦ Dissonant Whispers ♦ Divine Favour ♦ Enhance Leap ♦ Ensnaring Strike ♦ Entangle ♦ Expeditious Retreat ♦ Faerie Fire ♦ False Life ♦ Feather Fall ♦ Find Familiar ♦ Find Familiar: Cat ♦ Find Familiar: Crab ♦ Find Familiar: Frog ♦ Find Familiar: Rat ♦ Find Familiar: Raven ♦ Find Familiar: Spider ♦ Fog Cloud ♦ Goodberry ♦ Grease ♦ Guiding Bolt ♦ Hail of Thorns ♦ Healing Word ♦ Hellish Rebuke ♦ Heroism ♦ Hex ♦ Hunter's Mark ♦ Inflict Wounds ♦ Jump ♦ Longstrider ♦ Mage Armour ♦ Magic Missile ♦ Protection from Evil and Good ♦ Ray of Sickness ♦ Sanctuary ♦ Searing Smite (Spell) ♦ Shield ♦ Shield of Faith ♦ Sleep ♦ Speak with Animals ♦ Tasha's Hideous Laughter ♦ Thunderous Smite ♦ Thunderwave ♦ Witch Bolt ♦ Wrathful Smite",
