Feats are special talents or expertises that provide special capabilities to characters. At certain levels, your character will get to choose between an Ability Score Improvement Feature or a Feat.\n\nTough Information\n\nYour hit point maximum increases by 2 for every level you have gained.\n\nHow to Unlock Tough\n\nYou'll need to fulfill the following requirements to unlock Tough\n\nAll Classes at Level 4\n\nTough Tips & Notes\n\n\"Hit Point Increase\" is the name of the Feature granted by this Feat, which basically has the same effect but given as a Feature. This feat is retroactive. Which means it grants +2 HP for every level. For example, if you take the feat at Level 5, you get 2HP per level, which equals out to 10 HP. This is still the exact same as \"double your current level at hp\", in this case 5x2 = 10HP increase. Recommended for new players as they learn the mechanics of the game, especially during the first playthrough. You can swap it out later once you have a better understanding of the game mechanics, classes, and combat in general.
