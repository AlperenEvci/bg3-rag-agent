  "content": "Saving Throw is a mechanic in Baldur's Gate 3. Saving throws are used to calculate the defense of a character against many effects or Spells in the game. Each of these has its own Difficulty Class (DC), which the character must make a saving throw of the die against in order to protect themselves.\n\nSaving Throw in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nA saving throw (also called a save) represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm\n\nMaking a Saving Throw\n\nTo make a saving throw, roll a D20 and add the appropriate Ability Modifier for the character. Just like Ability Checks and Attack Rolls, you must hit the target number or higher in order to succeed.\n\nA saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by Advantage and Disadvantage.\n\nThe result of a successful or failed saving throw. Usually, a successful save means that a character suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect\n\nSaving Throw Difficulty Class\n\nThe Difficulty Class (DC) for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.\n\nSaving Throw Proficiency\n\nEach Class gives proficiency in two Saving Throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves. As with Skill proficiencies, Proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.\n\nSaving Throw Proficiency By Class\n\nBarbarian: Strength and Constitution Bard: Dexterity and Charisma Cleric: Wisdom and Charisma Druid: Intelligence and Wisdom Fighter: Strength and Constitution Monk: Strength and Dexterity Paladin: Wisdom and Charisma Ranger: Strength and Dexterity Rogue: Dexterity and Intelligence Sorcerer: Constitution and Charisma Warlock: Wisdom and Charisma Wizard: Intelligence and Wisdom\n\nSaving Throws and Spells\n\nIf you are making a spellcasting character, like a Wizard or Sorcerer you want to have the highest DC you can on your Spells because this will make it harder for Enemies to succeed a Saving Throw.\n\nSuch as is the case with Weapons, each Spellcasting class uses a different Ability that is used to calculate the Spellcasting Ability Modifier:\n\nClerics, Druids, and Rangers use Wisdom Arcane Tricksters, Eldritch Knights, and Wizards, use Intelligence Bards, Sorcerers, Paladins, and Warlocks use Charisma\n\nThe DC to resist one of your spells is calculated is always 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Spellcasting Ability Modifier.\n\nFor example, if your Druid casts the spell Call Lightning around a bunch of Goblins. The Druid is Level 5, so he has a Proficiency Bonus of +3, and his Wisdom is 18, so he has a Spellcasting Ability Modifier of +4. This means the DC of this Spell is 15 (8+3+4). Any Goblin who doesn't roll at least roll a 15, will take 3d10 damage (The sum of three rolls of a d10 die), and any who does will take half that amount.\n\nSaving Throws are affected by the Ability Score Modifier of the ability they're tied to. In addition to that, a creature can be Proficient in a type of Saving Throw, allowing it to add its Proficiency Bonus to the roll.\n\nAbility Score Modifier Value 1 -5 2-3 -4 4-5 -3 6-7 -2 8-9 -1 10-11 +0 12-13 +1 14-15 +2 16-17 +3 18-19 +4 20-21 +5 22-23 +6 24-25 +7 26-27 +8 28-29 +9 30 +10\n\nSaving Throws can also be affected by Advantage or Disadvantage. For example, Elves have Advantage on Saving Throws against being Charmed. As another example, the Bleeding condition incurs Disadvantage on Constitution Saves.\n\nSome spells can also affect a saving throw, such as Bane, Bless, and Resistance.",
