Use Cunning Action to hide and gain advantage for Sneak Attack, using ranged attacks or well-timed movement to capitalize on it.\n\nArcane Trickster\n\nThe Arcane Trickster is one of the three available subclasses for the Rogue, the other two being the Thief and the Assassin. The Arcane Trickster could be basically explained as a Rogue that has the ability to cast up to level 2 Spells. This gives the Arcane Trickster a vast array of abilities. an uncommon item that can be found in the Blighted Village can be extremely useful for Arcane Tricksters. Especially if their Intelligence isn't too high. While wearing the Warped Headband of Intellect, the Intelligence ability is set to 17. Knowing this beforehand, allows players to dump Intelligence to a low-level in character creation and use the remaining points in other Abilities. At level 9, Arcane Tricksters learn Magical Ambush. While hidden, Arcane Trickster targets have Disadvantage on Saving Throws against their Spells. Given the nature of Rogues of attacking from the shadows, Magical Ambush is a great feature to have.\n\nChoose Assassin for automatic advantage against enemies who haven't acted yet, facilitating Sneak Attack triggers. The Assassin is the more DPS-focused subclass of the Rogue, being able to deal massive burst damage on a single attack. Especially effective against unprepared Enemies, and also against creatures that haven't taken a turn yet. At level 3, Assassins learn Assassinate: Initiative, which grants them Advantage on Attack Rolls against creatures that haven’t taken a turn yet. At level 3, Assassins learn Assassinate: Ambush, which make any successful Attack Roll against a Surprised creature a Critical Hit. At level 3, Assassins learn Assassin's Alacrity, which immediately restores Actions and bonus actions at the start of combat. Making Assassins always ready for a fight. Gloves of Missile Snaring are a good defensive piece of equipment Rogues can equip. They possess the ability to reduce damage from ranging attacks by 1d10 + the Rogue's Dexterity Modifier. Elegant Studded Leather grants +2 to Initiative rolls, granting Assassins the chance to exploit their early-combat burst damage as soon as possible.\n\nThe Thief in a way is the most common and expected perception of a Rogue, a nimble and agile character, that benefits from hiding and moves around the battlefield freely. At level 3, the Thief learns Fast Hands which grants a second Bonus Action for every turn. Having more options on each turn is incredibly beneficial, granting them the possibility to move further on the battlefield, heal by consuming a potion, disengage from combat or hide in the shadows. Thanks to all three available cunning actions (Cunning Action: Hide, Cunning Action: Dash and Cunning Action: Disengage), this second bonus action allows thieves to have further options at their disposal. At level 3, thieves also learn Second-Story Work, receiving resistance to falling damage. It is not a game-changing ability, but may come useful in certain scenarios. At level 9, the Thief learns Supreme Sneak which is an action that allows the thief to become completely invisible. Useful for escaping and repositioning or attacking from the shadows, dealing massive damage. Note that attacking will break the invisibility.\n\nIn Other Languages\n\nEspañol (España): Pícaro\n\nAll Rogue Spells in Baldurs Gate 3\n\nRogue Spells in Baldur's Gate 3 are regulated forms of magic energy.
