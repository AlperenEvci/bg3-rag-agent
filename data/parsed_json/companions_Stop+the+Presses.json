Stop the Presses can be acquired during Act 3. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earning more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nStop the Presses Objectives\n\nTalk to the editor of the Baldur's Mouth Gazette. Stop the Baldur's Mouth Gazette printing slander. Print a puff piece in the next broadsheet. Check the next edition of the Baldur's Mouth Gazette.\n\nStop the Presses Walkthrough\n\nSpeak to Estra Stir (south of the Basilisk Gate in the Lower City), you learn that the party is the subject of the Baldur's Mouth Gazette's next issue - the juiciest one to date. This is a time-sensitive quest, you need to complete it before long rest or your reputation is tarnished. To stop the press, you need to sneak into the basement of Baldur's Mouth. Either use Misty Step, Fly or Dimensional Door to reach the door or elevator. Or persuade/intimidate guards to let you pass.(To avoid being caught, you can jump onto the roof of Baldur's Mouth, break the barricade and jump to the elevator.) There are two steal watchers patrolling the basement. Hide your character and don't make any noise (like looting or stealing) near the steel watch to avoid getting caught. You can use turn-based mode to move your characters precisely. (Sneak pass the Steel Watchers in turn-based mode. Invisibility spell can also help.) Take the press template called Cutest Cat You've Ever Seen or \"Make Big Money By Trading With Adventures\" In the same room in the wicker basket. The latter one is about your good deeds and states that will give you a positive reputation and help with trading. Other positive articles includes: Make Big Money by Trading with Adventurers (in a basket near X:-1029, Y:1058) Adventurers, Our Best Hope for the City (in a basket near X:-1029, Y:1013) Celebrate the Brave Heroes Who Slew General Ketheric (in a basket behind Ettvard) Other neutral articles are Hear the Finest Shanties at the Blushing Mermaid (X:43, Y:-60) and Graverobbers Spree (X:58, Y:-42).\n\nMake Big Money by Trading with Adventurers (in a basket near X:-1029, Y:1058) Adventurers, Our Best Hope for the City (in a basket near X:-1029, Y:1013) Celebrate the Brave Heroes Who Slew General Ketheric (in a basket behind Ettvard)\n\nIf you freed Dolly Dolly Dolly from the Moonlantern in Act 2, the press recognizes the party and offers to help. Otherwise, you need to persuad it. Insert the \"Make Big Money By Trading With Adventures\" or \"Cutest Cat You've Ever Seen\" into the printing press to protect your reputation. As of patch 3, killing Ettvard also stops the negative articles being published.\n\nHow to unlock Stop the Presses\n\nStop the Presses Rewards\n\nPossible discount form traders.\n\nStop the Presses Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
