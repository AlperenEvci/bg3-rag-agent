Given this feat also increases an attribute by +1, this is a solid option if it gets you an even number in Strength or Dexterity. This feat works with all forms of Wild Shape. Works great with Monk's Step of the Wind Dash. With this feat, the jump will no longer cost a Bonus Action per turn.\n\nAll Feats in Baldur's Gate 3 Ability Improvements ♦ Actor ♦ Alert ♦ Charger ♦ Crossbow Expert ♦ Defensive Duellist ♦ Dual Wielder ♦ Dungeon Delver ♦ Durable ♦ Elemental Adept ♦ Great Weapon Master ♦ Heavily Armoured ♦ Heavy Armour Master ♦ Lightly Armoured ♦ Lucky (Feat) ♦ Mage Slayer ♦ Magic Initiate: Bard ♦ Magic Initiate: Cleric ♦ Magic Initiate: Druid ♦ Magic Initiate: Sorcerer ♦ Magic Initiate: Warlock ♦ Magic Initiate: Wizard ♦ Martial Adept ♦ Medium Armour Master ♦ Mobile ♦ Moderately Armoured ♦ Observant ♦ Performer ♦ Polearm Master ♦ Resilient ♦ Ritual Caster ♦ Savage Attacker ♦ Sentinel ♦ Sharpshooter ♦ Shield Master ♦ Skilled ♦ Spell Sniper ♦ Tavern Brawler ♦ Tough ♦ Unstable Blood ♦ War Caster ♦ Weapon Master",
