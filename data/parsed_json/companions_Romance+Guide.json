Players that develop enough relationship with a companion, will get the chance to romantically interact with them creating a deeper relationship and even having sex. Your companions will form opinions about your character based on your actions and your dialogue choices, as well as the factions that you choose to side with.

This can be achieved by performing actions your desired companion approves of and avoiding actions that they disapprove of. These actions include every action that the player takes regarding other NPCs and how you handle different situations.\n\nAiding your desired companion in their personal objectives is also key to developing a romantic relationship. You can talk with them during the campaign or during your adventure to help them sort out their individual quests.\n\nEach companion has different ideologies, so learning about their personalities will help you achieve your romantic goal. You can learn more about each companion by visiting the companions page.\n\nStarting a Romance & Camp in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nThe Camp is the best place to grow your relationship with your companions. While you are at the Camp screen (while you are resting), you'll be able to have deeper interactions and conversations with them. When a companion has developed enough confidence in you, you'll get the chance to engage them in a romantic dialogue, starting the romance.\n\nOnce you successfully engage a companion romantically, you'll have more dialogue options that can lead to intimacy.\n\nRomanceable Characters in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nCharacter Romance Guide for Baldur's Gate 3\n\nAstarion is a High Elf Rogue who has prowled the night as a vampire spawn for centuries, serving a sadistic master until he was snatched away.

As long as you use your wit and cunning for anything justifiable, you should earn yourself approval from her. Shadowheart also has a rivalry with Lae'zel, so going against Lae'zel and supporting Shadowheart whenever the choice presents itself will also raise her approval of you. However, this obviously goes against Lae'zels approval as well so players will have to be wary of that. Being successful with Persuasion, Deception, Religion, and Insight checks will grant you her approval as well as long as she's in your current party.\n\nSHADOWHEART APPROVAL EXPLOIT:\n\nUpon discovering a damaged helmet on a body in the Blighted Village and passing a few skill checks in dialogue with Shadowheart, you can get her to reveal her worship of Shar.After this, the following dialogue option can be repeated in camp to gain infinite approval increase:\n\nWe should get to know each other better.

Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.\n\nYou're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.\n\nShadowheart Dialogue & Camp Interactions\n\nShadowheart BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS\n\nShadowheart BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS\n\nA Human Wizard, Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard Faerun has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an explosion that can level a city.

Agree to open the gate for the goblin raiders.\n\nGale BG3 Romance Guide\n\nWhere to find Gale in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nPlayers can find Gale right after the prologue, at the Roadside Cliffs waypoint located just above the Nautilus shipwreck. To learn more about Gale, please visit his page by clicking here.\n\nGale Approval Guide in BG3\n\nGale can probably be considered the most morally upright Companion in the game's early stages, making it relatively simple to earn his favor by assisting others and completing side quests. He has a strong affinity for helping people and performing virtuous acts, while he strongly dislikes unethical behavior, particularly morally questionable actions, which leads to more instances of his disapproval compared to other Companions. This can make it quite easy to raise approval with him as you go as in a normal playthrough, you'd be adventuring around and solving all sorts of problems and resolving all sorts of conflicts anyway. Offering consumable artifacts, as per his condition, and interacting with camp animals are also effective ways to win his approval.\n\nAs a master of magic, Gale will approve of instances where the player showcases their Intelligence rather than violent, brute force approaches, a trait he shares with Shadowheart, as well as any decision that arises from the knowledge of the arts, science, and poetry. As a Human, he subscribes to a more general sense of morality, so acts of kindness will also gain his approval. Conversely, one can incur his disapproval by resorting to unnecessary violence, displaying stupidity, lacking curiosity, or passing judgment on his condition, or other people with similar circumstances.\n\nRomancing Gale in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nYour relationship with Gale can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting his approval up, players may approach him at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with him should be high enough so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. Remember that actions that lean toward heroism will get a good amount of approval for him, and might even come up in your dialogues. For example, making sure to save the Tiefling children during the Quest Investigate the Beach will create a relevant dialogue option for you.\n\nYou're on the right track with Gale if you find him in camp with an exclamation mark on his head, as he's staring at a hologram he's producing at the palm of his hand. He won't really get into who the hologram was of, but he will try and teach you how to perform magic by channeling the Weave. Naturally, it'll be in your best interest to be successful in your attempts so do your best and pick the Ability check that you have the highest score in. Naturally, it is also in your best interest to keep it going so avoid the choices that'll make the experience come to a halt. Eventually, you'll be asked to imagine a picture that Gale will be receptive to, through your connection to the Weave. Choose to either picture kissing him or taking a romantic walk with him. Nothing will happen yet, but he will be aware of your intentions and will be open to them. When you talk to him next, ask him what he thought of what you had pictured. Unlike some of the other Companions, this doesn't start your official relationship with him per se, but it will make your intentions known and pave the path for it.\n\nGale BG3 Dialogue & Camp Interactions\n\nGale BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS\n\nGale BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS\n\nLae'zel is a consummate Fighter, ferocious even by the standards of a Githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first.\n\nLae'zel Romance Approval Choices\n\nAll Lae'zel Approval Up Choices\n\nShow Guex in the Druid Grove your sword fighting technique (Athletics check). Choose to attack Taman and Gimblelock in dialogue outside the Crypt. When talking to Zevlor the first time inside the Druid Grove, tell him you're sorry but you have no time to help him. During dialogue with Lae'zel, after she describes ceremorphosis, tell her you will find a cure. If Kagha's snake kills Arabella, tell her \"She was just protecting her own.\" in dialogue afterwards. Swear to Nettie you will take the poison. Crush the Tadpole outside of the Druid Grove. Decline the Devil's invitation to remove your Tadpole. Respond to Volo in the Goblin Camp with \"-\". Make Novice Crusher kiss your foot in the Goblin Camp. Resist during the first dream sequence. Cruel behaviors. Calm down the boat near the vampire. Fight the fake god Boooal in THE FESTERING COVE. Allowing her to speak to her githyanki brothers/sisters.\n\nAll Lae'zel Approval Down Choices\n\nConvince the Owlbear not to kill you in its cave. Try to persuade the goblin guard outside the Goblin Camp. Smear dung on your face when Sentinel Olak asks you to. Lae'zel has a rivalry attitude towards Shadowheart, heed to Shadowheart's advice will upset her. Sympathetic behaviors. Disapproves if you succeed in the persuasion check to stop Kagha from imprisoning the child. Agreeing with Shadowheart whenever given the chance.\n\nLae'zel BG3 Romance Guide\n\nWhere to find Lae'zel in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nPlayers can find Lae'zel on the Nautiloid ship during the prologue and is the first companion member you recruit to help with your escape. However, once the prologue is complete, she will leave. Players can find her on Revenge Beach, north of the Roadside Cliffs. To learn more about Lae'zel, please visit her page by clicking here.\n\nLae'zel Approval Guide in BG3\n\nPlayers will have to make tougher, more aggressive decisions and dialog choices as Lae'zel isn't a very sympathetic or sentimental person. Before romancing Lae'zel, players will need to make sure to be as chaotic as she is, as she is only on the journey for her own interests and is not willing to make stops for others. Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.\n\nTo gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.\n\nRomancing Lae'zel in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nYour relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point.\n\nYou're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyank method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to flirtingly ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!\n\nLae'zel BG3 Dialogue & Camp Interactions\n\nLae'zel BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS\n\nLae'zel BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS\n\nA Human Warlock, and Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic 'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden, and is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.\n\nWyll Romance Approval Choices\n\nAll Wyll Approval Up Choices\n\nShow Guex in the Druid Grove your sword fighting technique. Crush the Tadpole outside of the Druid Grove. Tell Scratch (dog) that he can come to your Camp if his friend doesn't wake up. Try to persuade the goblin guard outside the Goblin Camp. Agree to fight Fezzerk in the Blighted Village. Decline the Devil's invitation to remove your Tadpole. Agree to help Zevlor. Make Novice Crusher kiss your foot in the Goblin Camp. Help Karlach in Hunt the Devil quest.\n\nAll Wyll Approval Down Choices\n\nSmear dung on your face when Sentinel Olak asks you to. If you choose to walk in on the two trolls having sex in the Blighted Village. Cruel Behaviors. Agree to open the gate for goblin raiders. He will leave you if side with the goblins. If you stop the Tiefling from killing Sazza in the cage.\n\nWyll BG3 Romance Guide\n\nWhere to find Wyll in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nPlayers can find Wyll during chapter one, in the Remove the Parasite quest. You will be able to recruit him after the battle against Goblins at the gates of the encampment. To learn more about Wyll, please visit his page by clicking here.\n\nWyll Approval Guide in BG3\n\nNormally, players will need to make conversation and do the right actions to gain approval with their companions however, it is a bit tricky with Wyll. He is noble and admires when players chooses to be heroic, lending a helping hand as well as going against selfishness, entitled behavior, and never siding with monsters such as Devils, and Goblins.\n\nRomancing Wyll in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nPlayers will need to speak to Wyll back at the camp and ask him about the Goblins and the Tieflings, doing so gets Wyll to open up about why he dislikes Goblins so much. When asked about Wylls glass eye, he decides not to share this because he does not know the player well enough to open up about it. Later on, players will need to choose not to bring him along to the goblin camp or the windmill in the Blighted Village, doing either of these will trigger Wyll to talk about his past and his glass eye.\n\nAt this point, players may not have access to romance him yet. Instead, take Wyll out of your party and head over to the Blighted Village. Head over to the windmill, speak with Spike and pursuade him into giving the prisoner that is strapped onto the windmill, to the player. Do not torture him, but release him instead. Head back to the campsite and add Wyll back into the party then head to the Goblin Camp. Look for Spike and speak about Mizora, players will need to kill Spike and Abdirak when he says that Mizora is no longer there.\n\nEnd the day here and speak with Wyll back at the campsite, Wyll will then open up about Mizora. Go to bed after this conversation. Head back to the Goblin Camp and speak with Halsin in their prison, hunt down all of the Goblin leaders while Wyll is still in your party. This gives the option of Romancing Wyll later on.\n\nWyll BG3 Dialogue & Camp Interactions\n\nWyll BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS\n\nWyll BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS\n\nKarlach is a Barbarian Tiefling that was sold young to an Archdevil in order to fight in the blood wars, the never-ending battle that rages on in the nine hells. Now that she is free, she seeks revenge on the one who sold her in the first place.\n\nKarlach Romance Approval Choices\n\nAll Karlach Approval Up Choices\n\nShowing your strength. Freeing slaves\n\nAll Karlach Approval Down Choices\n\nKarlach BG3 Romance Guide\n\nWhere to find Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nPlayers can find Karlach at The Risen Road, in the side quest Hunt the Devil. To learn more about Karlack, please visit her page by clicking here.\n\nKarlach Approval Guide in BG3\n\nAs of now, players can raise Karlach's approval by showing their strength to her as well as freeing slaves as she was once enslaved when she was younger. Gaining Karlach's approval centers around being forthcoming and somewhat heroic - showing compassion toward the wronged and almost uncompromising good. This might put decisions that will gain her approval at odds with other Companions like Shadowheart and Lae'Zel. Additionally, her context as someone who just escaped the Hells makes attunes her towards people who do actions that express their love of life and being outgoing. As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Karlach, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. Karlach is one of the easier Companions to create a bond with as she is not too closed off or secretive. Part of this dynamic will be the fact that anyone she touches gets burned, which will have her yearning for your physical affection when you start being open about your feelings toward one another. She'll be sincere and upfront with her affection for you, so you only need to be the same.\n\nRomancing Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nYour relationship with Karlach can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines in mind above, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. One surefire way to increase affection with her is to follow her Companion Quest. This entails finding Infernal Iron and bringing it to the Tiefling Dammon. Eventually, this will let you speak to her at camp and offer to have an idea to help with her little fire problem. Afterward, use any Spell or Action that creates ice or water and direct it at Karlach. You can also do the same thing with a water barrel or anything similar you can interact with. Talk to her again and choose to test things out with a kiss. It's important to note that while it might not be a certainty, this might count as an attempt at romance already, and so while your relationship hasn't officially started by any means, it might lock you out of pursuing other Companions.\n\nTo romance Karlach, players only need to be forward with wanting to spend more time with her. As mentioned previously, she will have no pretense about responding to your affections. Choose the appropriate responses to flirt with her and hint at wanting to risk the pain to be able to touch her. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to think of Karlach. By clicking on Karlach, players share a moment with her right there on their bunk. You'll try and share a more prolonged intimate moment together before she'll stop you for fear of hurting you further. As previously mentioned, just keep being forward with her about your feelings, and don't be afraid to express your affection to officially start your tense, yearning relationship with her.\n\nKarlach BG3 Dialogue & Camp Interactions\n\nKarlach BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS\n\nKarlach BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS\n\nMinthara is a ruthless Drow that is preparing an assault on Druid Grove.

After slaying every Tiefling and wiping out the druids, return to Minthara. Minthara will offer to join you at your camp. End the day to camp and speak to Minthara. She will join you once you head to your bed.\n\nDuring the following cutscene you have to choose:\n\nSearch for her desires: this will result in the possibility to persuade [Persuasion 8]her in the following conversation. [Wisdom Check ?6?]: Search her fears: this will result in having to intimidate her [Intimidation 16] or initiate combat. Failing to Persuade/Intimidate her will result in being attacked by her inside your camp.\n\nAll Minthara Approval Down Choices\n\nMinthara BG3 Romance Guide\n\nWhere to find Minthara in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nMinthara can first be found in Act I within the Shattered Sanctum, inside the Goblin Camp as one of the three Goblin leaders. Siding with her allows the opening of the branching storyline that allows Tav to side with the Goblins and start the Quest Raid the Grove which may lead to recruiting her in Act II. In Act II, she will be on trial and eventually under torture in the Moonrise Towers. Rescuing her there will allow you to officially recruit her as a Companion.\n\nOtherwise, siding with the Tieflings and killing the goblins will have you kill Minthara as well. The same result will come from siding with her first (and successfully initiating an intimate night with her) and then failing to convince her of your shared affiliation with the Absolute later on. Both routes will lock you out of recruiting or romancing Minthara.\n\nMinthara Approval Guide in BG3\n\nApproval Guide for Minthara goes here.\n\nRomancing Minthara in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nWhen you first meet her in the Shattered Sanctum, you have the option to betray the Druids and the Tieflings and side with Minthara instead as a fellow True Soul for the Absolute. Just click the appropriate responses that go toward deciding to help her. As per the plan, you'll go back to the Grove and pretend to still be on the side of the Tieflings. When Minthara and her army arrive, she'll give you the telepathic signal to open the gate and begin a combat engagement to slaughter the Tieflings.\n\nTo get the early romance scene with Minthara, you'll just have to speak with her and affirm the start of your would-be relationship, and express to her that you're ready to be hers. Afterward, head to your bed roll. The scene will automatically initiate when you rest. When it ends, you'll have the option to telepathically pry into her desires or her fears. In the Early Access, trying for her fears and succeeding will lead to undesirable results, but it is not certain currently if this remains to be the case in the full game. She will share her thoughts all the same if you choose to pry into her desires, and will explain that she cannot hear the Absolute when she is with you. You have the option to spill the secret about Shadowheart's artifact if you'd like but it may have certain ramifications later on. When she lets you go, you'll actually get to rest, but only until she attempts to murder you in your sleep. Suffice it to say, unlike other Companions, this whole encounter doesn't spell the start of your relationship. The important dialogue option here will be when you'll either try to persuade or deceive her with the relevant checks to convince her that you are allied with her under the Absolute. Doing anything else other than those two will result in her betrayal and you'll be forced to kill her in a combat engagement, locking you out of being able to recruit her, much less romance her.\n\nAct II will eventually bring you to the Moonrise Towers during the Quest Infiltrate Moonrise Towers. Inside the towers, you'll be able to find Minthara being mentally tortured to the point of erasure. The dialogue options will allow you to either do an Intimidation check or a Deception check so that they can leave Minthara's punishment to you instead. If successful you can make a Wisdom check to try and telepathically reach her. Note that at any point, you can choose to instead go for a brute force approach and try to kill her captors instead. Once you reach her, you'll have the same choice of propositions to offer her. If you choose to try the more peaceful approach, you'll have to make either an Intimidation, Deception, or Persuasion check to fool the Questioners and you'll have to keep this up for any other characters you'll bump into or you'll have to engage them in battle, until you exit Moonrise. There, you'll have the option to let her in on everything you've learned so far as well as the location of your camp. From then on you can bring her along as an official Companion and raise her approval of you.\n\nMinthara BG3 Dialogue & Camp Interactions\n\nMinthara BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS\n\nMinthara BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS\n\nHalsin can be found as a prisoner at the Worg Pens, deep within the Shattered Sanctum. Halsin is the first Druid of the Druid Grove, but has been missing since he left with Aradin's expetidition.\n\nHalsin Romance Approval Choices\n\nAll Halsin Approval Up Choices\n\nApproval Up Choices to be added.\n\nAll Halsin Approval Down Choices\n\nApproval Down Choices to be added.\n\nHalsin BG3 Romance Guide\n\nWhere to find Halsin in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nYou learn about Halsin for the first time at the Druid Grove. He has gone with Aradin's expedition to the Goblin Camp, but he never managed to return because he was captured. He can be found at the Worg Pens. If you free him, he offers to join you during the raid of the goblin camp. Doing this, he will be at your side, but every NPC that crosses your path will be automatically hostile.\n\nIf you raze the Goblin Camp and kill the three goblin leaders (True Soul Gut, Dror Ragzlin and Minthara) before talking to him at the Worg pens, you will find Halsin has left his cage and has returned to the Druid Grove by himself. After introducing himself, he thanks you for your actions and immediately senses you have a problem he can help you with.\n\nAfter the events at the Shattered Sanctum, Halsin will then return to the Druid Grove. If you have exposed Kagha, he will be having a word with her. Once the Tiefling party is over, he will tell you about Moonrise Towers.\n\nHalsin Approval Guide in BG3\n\nHalsin is different compared to other companions as he cannot be recruited as a party member until Act II, though you are able to flirt with him already after you first meet him in Act I during the Quest Save the Refugees or Rescue the Druid Halsin.\n\nRomancing Halsin in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nAs you go through Act II, you'll eventually make it to the Last Light Inn. Certain situations may trigger the devastation of the inn, especially if you chose to play as The Dark Urge, so make sure to choose the options that will preserve everything and everyone, as much as possible. Making sure to keep the inn intact leads to encountering someone there called the \"Sleeping man.\" Speaking with him prompts a Quest from Halsin to find Thaniel, a child he seeks. This Quest will eventually entail protecting Halsin as he attempts to travel inter-dimensionally. This can be a difficult fight as you'll have to keep him alive in a difficult combat engagement until he finishes his task. Successfully clearing the quest will reward you with finally being able to officially recruit Halsin and thus make him available for romance. Make sure to keep clearing out any other Quests surrounding Halsin as you build approval with him.\n\nWhen you get your approval with Halsin enough as an official Companion, you can talk to him at camp with the exclamation point over his head for his intimate scene. Follow the conversation with affirming dialogue options, until he mentions having many previous lovers. Ask him what exactly he means by this to get his direct confession. If you were holding out all this time for Halsin, you'll simply need to assure him that you reciprocate his feelings. Otherwise, you'll have to be honest about it and say that you're interested but you're already with somebody else. He will explain that he does not mind sharing you, as he sees romance and partnership as a fluid system, much like nature to which he is so attuned. As a good partner who respects their lover, you'll have to go and have a talk with your current partner and see how they feel about polyamory. Astarion, Karlach, and Shadowheart have been confirmed to not mind. Naturally, if they do mind, and if you mind yourself, you can choose to break it off with them and exclusively be with Halsin. After you get their permission, head back promptly to Halsin and let him know to initiate the famous love scene. When he loses control and turns into a bear, you'll have the option to choose whether or not you'd like him to continue the deed in human form or as a bear. No one will judge you, as long as you both are happy.\n\nHalsin BG3 Dialogue & Camp Interactions\n\nHalsin BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS\n\nHalsin BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS\n\nMinsc was a kind-hearted—but rather addled— Rashemaar warrior that enjoyed many adventures across the Sword Coast and beyond.\n\nMinsc Romance Approval Choices\n\nAll Minsc Approval Up Choices\n\nApproval Up Choices to be added.\n\nAll Minsc Approval Down Choices\n\nApproval Down Choices to be added.\n\nMinsc BG3 Romance Guide\n\nWhere to find Minsc in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nInformation on where and how to find Minsc in Baldur's Gate 3 to be indicated here.\n\nMinsc Approval Guide in BG3\n\nApproval Guide for Minsc to be indicated here.\n\nRomancing Minsc in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nRomance Guide for Minsc to be indicated here.\n\nMinsc BG3 Dialogue & Camp Interactions\n\nMinsc BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS\n\nMinsc BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS\n\nJaheira Romance Approval Choices\n\nAll Jaheira Approval Up Choices\n\nApproval Up Choices to be added.\n\nAll Jaheira Approval Down Choices\n\nApproval Down Choices to be added.\n\nJaheira BG3 Romance Guide\n\nWhere to find Jaheira in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nInformation on where and how to find Jaheira in Baldur's Gate 3 to be indicated here.\n\nJaheira Approval Guide in BG3\n\nApproval Guide for Jaheira to be indicated here.\n\nRomancing Jaheira in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nRomance Guide for Jaheira to be indicated here.\n\nJaheira BG3 Dialogue & Camp Interactions\n\nJaheira BG3 IMPORTANT DIALOGUE OPTIONS\n\nJaheira BG3 IMPORTANT CAMP INTERACTIONS",
