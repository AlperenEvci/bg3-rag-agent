Shield Dwarf has both Medium and Light Armor Proficiencies. While creating your Character in Baldur's Gate 3, you can choose between 11 different types of Races. Each of them has their special characteristics and some of them have Sub-Races which provide different Features and Traits.\n\nBG3 Full Game Note: In the full launch of Baldur's Gate 3, Ability Score Points for Races that were present in Early Access are removed. And instead, Ability Score Points in the full game correspond with the Class players will choose.\n\nShield dwarves survived a long fall from grace, surrendering many of their ancient kingdoms in wars with goblins and orcs. These losses have lead to a cynical mindset, yet shield dwarves will endure anything to restore their ancestral homelands.\n\nShield Dwarf Traits in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nDwarven Armour Training: You have Armour Proficiency with Light and Medium Armour.\n\nBG3 Dwarf Features\n\nBase Racial Speed: Move up to 7.5m per turn. Dwarven Combat Training: Proficiency with the Battleaxe, Handaxe, Light Hammer, and Warhammer. Darkvision: See in the dark up to 12m. Dwarven Resilience: Advantage on Saving Throws against Poison, and you have resistance against Poison damage.\n\nShield Dwarf Tips & Notes\n\nDuring Early Access, the Shield Dwarf race used to feature +2 Constitution and +2 Strength. This has been changed in the full launch of BG3 and the Ability Score points are now associated with the Class that players will choose.\n\nRaces and Subraces Asmodeus Tiefling ♦ Black Dragonborn ♦ Blue Dragonborn ♦ Brass Dragonborn ♦ Bronze Dragonborn ♦ Copper Dragonborn ♦ Deep Gnome ♦ Drow ♦ Drow Half-Elf ♦ Duergar ♦ Dwarf ♦ Elf ♦ Forest Gnome ♦ Githyanki ♦ Gnome ♦ Gold Dragonborn ♦ Gold Dwarf ♦ Green Dragonborn ♦ Half-Drow ♦ Half-Elf ♦ Halfling ♦ High Elf ♦ High Half-Elf ♦ Human ♦ Lightfoot Halfling ♦ Lolth-Sworn Drow ♦ Mephistopheles Tiefling ♦ Red Dragonborn ♦ Rock Gnome ♦ Seldarine Drow ♦ Silver Dragonborn ♦ Strongheart Halfling ♦ Tiefling ♦ White Dragonborn ♦ Wood Elf ♦ Wood Half-Elf ♦ Zariel Tiefling",
