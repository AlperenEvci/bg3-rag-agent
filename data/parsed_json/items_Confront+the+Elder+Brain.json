After your failed attempt, your team will be teleported to Astral Plane. There you need to decide whether to let Emperor suck Prince Orpheus' brain, or free Orpheus (with the Hammer you get in quest Free Orpheus) and let him or one of your teammates turn into Mind Flayer. Depending on your choice, Emperor or Orpheus will join your team. Now you lead your team all the way to the High Hall. Remember you can now summon as many allies as you want during the fight. But they can only be summoned in battle, and they will not be summoned again once they die. On your way to the Elder Brain, A Nautiloid will aim and bombard the area when you climb the stairs. Stay away from the marked area ASAP to avoid being killed. If you find the fight in High Hall courtyard too diffcult, you can use the Upper City Sewer, which provides you a short cut to High Hall, guarded by Death Knight Stalker Svignee and some other enemies.(The entrance to the Upper City Sewers a Metal Door at X264, Y128.) When you reach on top of Elder Brain, you need to defeat the enemies and get close enough to Karsus' Crown to cast the control spell. You need to protect the caster in the meantime. Successfully casting the spell opens the portal to Elder Brain, you need to kill it before it breaks from the spells (4 turns).
