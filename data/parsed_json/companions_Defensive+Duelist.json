However they tend to deal slightly less damage than their non-Finesse counterparts to compensate. Defensive Duellist makes it so that when you're attacked while wielding a finesse weapon that you're proficient with, you can use a reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your Armor Class, possibly causing the attack of an enemy to miss. Usually, when you're using a finesse weapon, you're probably using two finesse weapons, so this is usually on a dual-wielding character, usually not always, which means they're not using a shield, so their Armor Class is typically going to be lower. This will help you offset that by allowing you to use your reaction (which is once every round) to help protect you against one attack. It's not a bad pickup at all. Keep in mind that if you pick up an Ability Score Improvement and increase your Dexterity, you would gain one Armor Class anyway, which, if this is the beginning of the game (level four), would be basically half the Armor Class you would gain from this because this would give you plus two to your Armor Class and Dexterity would give you plus one, plus all the other benefits. Good feat to combine with Hunter, or any class proficient with Medium Armor. There are several medium armors that have uncapped AC bonuses from Dexterity. You could possibly have a Ranger as an AC tank while equipping a medium armor.
