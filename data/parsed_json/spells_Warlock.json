You can check out our Warlock Guide here. Opt for The Fiend for offensive spells and a health-restoring feature upon defeating enemies, aiding in your character's survival. Cast Hex for extra damage and recast it after killing an enemy to maintain sustained bonus damage without consuming additional spell slots. Leverage Eldritch Blast as a primary damage-dealing option, enhancing it with Agonizing Blast and Repelling Blast invocations for increased damage and battlefield control. Eldritch Blast with the aforementioned enhancements can be a game changer, specially in places where there are chasms or against enemies that can be pushed from a high place to the ground, dealing massive damage. Gemini Gloves are an incredible option to boost Eldrich Blast, thanks to the Adroit Caster ability, which lets the wearer's cantrips target one more enemy or ally. Misty Step is another incredible good combination for repositioning and gaining Advantage with Eldritch Blast. Counterspell will allow you to control the field and prevent enemies from casting powerful Spells, by spending a reaction. If you rely heavily on Eldritch Blast for offensive and don't use many Spells, saving those spell slots for Counterspell will waste many turns of the enemies. Counterspell can be paired with Staff of Spellpower, thanks to its powerful ability Arcane Battery, which allows you to don't spend a spell slot on the next spell casted.\n\nYou can bind any melee weapon to you as your Pact weapon if you chose Pact of the Blade, allowing you to attack with your Charisma Modifier with it Pact of the Blade Extra Attack is not supposed to stack with other Extra Attacks per the description, but seems to currently. Hunger of Hadar is an amazing spell that can be used both for area denial, but also deal damage and crowd control at the same time. War Caster or Resilient (CON) are both good choices of Feats to help you maintain Concentration of spells like Hunger of Hadar, Darkness or Cloud of Daggers. Warlocks can multiclass well with Paladin, Sorcerer or Bard, since they all use Charisma to cast their Spells as well. Warlocks will most likely Multiclass after level 3 or level 9, depending on what class they are multiclassing, since they are very front-loaded. Warlock Spell Slots don't level up any higher when multiclassing, so if you want stronger Spell Slots you'll need to keep taking levels in Warlock. Warlocks can wear Medium Armour and use a Shield and still cast spells if they have Proficiency in these from their Race or other Class if they Multiclassed, and really should since it helps beef up their AC. Eldritch Blast gains a second beam at level 5 and third beam at level 10. This is character level though, not Warlock level, allowing you to multiclass and still have a powerful Eldritch Blast.\n\nYou can search by Name, Level, School, Casting Time and Class.
