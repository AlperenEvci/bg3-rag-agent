This will cause both versions to be unusable during these cutscenes and break the associated UI. Otherwise best used against NPCs you don't plan to meet again. If you are outside of an NPC's range when the effect ends, their attitude towards your character is not affected.\n\nCantrips Acid Splash ♦ Blade Ward ♦ Bone Chill ♦ Dancing Lights ♦ Eldritch Blast ♦ Fire Bolt ♦ Githyanki Psionics: Mage Hand ♦ Guidance ♦ Improved Minor Illusion ♦ Light ♦ Mage Hand ♦ Minor Illusion ♦ Poison Spray ♦ Produce Flame ♦ Ray of Frost ♦ Resistance ♦ Sacred Flame ♦ Selûne's Dream ♦ Shillelagh ♦ Shocking Grasp ♦ Thaumaturgy ♦ Thorn Whip ♦ True Strike ♦ Vicious Mockery",
