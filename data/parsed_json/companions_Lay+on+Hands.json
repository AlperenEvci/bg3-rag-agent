Try combining it with other healing spells, abilities, or items such as healing potions to ensure your survival in longer battles. Multiclass Consideration: If you happen to multiclass your Paladin, you need to be mindful of the synergies of the other class you picked. For example, if you've combined Paladin with a class that excels in healing, like the Cleric, you might want to prioritize the Cleric's healing and save the Lay on Hands for a different situation.
