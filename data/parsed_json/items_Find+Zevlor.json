  "content": "Find Zevlor Type Quest Act Act 2 Location Last Light Inn Reward Zevlor ally in Gather Your Allies\n\nFind Zevlor is a Quest in Baldur's Gate 3. Find Zevlor can be acquired during Act 2. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earning more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nFind Zevlor Objectives\n\nZevlor was captured by the cult of the Absolute. His fellow tieflings claim he froze and tried to surrender. We should look for him. The tieflings were captured and brought to Moonrise Towers, but Zevlor isn't with them. His fellow tieflings are angry with him - claiming he wanted to surrender. Some even think he was secretly a cultist. Something happened with Zevlor and the tieflings out in the darkness - something bad. And it sounds like the tieflings blame him for it. We should find out more. We found the tieflings, but Zevlor isn't with them. They claim he wanted to surrender to the cult. Some even think he was secretly a cultist. We should look for him. Arabella's father claims that Zevlor betrayed the tieflings, and tried to run. The tieflings were ambushed by the cultists out in the darkness. Zevlor urged them to surrender, and in the confusion the cultists attacked - kidnapping several of the tieflings.\n\nWe found Zevlor trapped in a pod - the same type we awoke in on the nautiloid. He will likely die without our help.\n\nWe opened the pods - releasing a host of mind flayers. We're in for a fight.\n\nQuest Complete Descriptions\n\nWe purged the mind flayer pods in the colony. Zevor was in one of them - he must have perished. We never found Zevlor. We couldn't save Zevlor from his fate. We saved Zevlor, who explained that he let the Absolute infiltrate his mind. It's unlikely the tieflings will welcome him back - he'll have to forge his own path now.\n\nFind Zevlor Walkthrough\n\nThis quest is only available if you managed to save tieflings in Save the Refugees. When you reach the Last Light Inn, you'll find Cerys at (X:-64, Y:141). If you talk to her, she'll reveal that she is a scout and that it's partly her fault that the Tieflings got ambushed. Apparently, Zevlor had begged them to surrender when they stood up to the cultists that captured them. Some of them were able to run free, but the others stayed captured, including Zevlor. You'll have to try and find him. Zevlor can be found in a pod in Mind Flayer Colony (X694 Y14, you can only reach this location after you defeat Ketheric in Moonrise Towers). Once you free him, you need to fight the mind flayer and intellect devourers in the room. After the battle, if Zevlor survives, he explains to you how he was enthralled by the Absolute. He can join you in Act 3 in quest Gather Your Allies.\n\nHow to unlock Find Zevlor\n\nCerys / Last Light Inn\n\nFind Zevlor Rewards\n\nZevlor ally in Gather Your Allies\n\nFind Zevlor Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
