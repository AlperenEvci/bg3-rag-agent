Opting for a custom Build unlocks a plethora of supplementary choices to shape and define your character uniquely. Players are allowed to tailor the following aspects as part of their customization process:\n\nRace / Subrace Class/ Subclass Background Ability\n\nConsider Premade Builds\n\nFor newcomers to the game who prefer not to opt for an Origins character but are interested in experimenting with a custom build, they have the option to explore a range of pre-made Builds crafted by fellow players. These pre-made Builds cater to various play styles and can be a suitable alternative.\n\nBest Melee Builds\n\nDruid - Circle of the Moon Barbarian - Berserker Bard - College of Valour Fighter - Eldritch Knight Warlock - Melee Rogue - Thief Paladin - Oath of Devotion Monk - Way of the Open Hand\n\nBest Ranged Builds\n\nWarlock - The Fiend Ranger - Hunter Cleric - Light Domain Wizard - Evocation School Sorcerer - Dragon Ancestor\n\nConsider the Build of Your Party\n\nWhen creating a Build, it's crucial to consider how your character might interact with or augment different Companions. Some of these Companions are available for selection on the Origins page on Character Creation. If you decide not to bring these specific Companions into your party, there's an alternative choice of utilizing Hirelings. These Hirelings are available to all classes and, similar to the Companions, can be Respecced to better align with your personal interest, aided by a certain enigmatic undead character. This allows for a versatile approach to building your group, enhancing the flexibility of your party composition.\n\nParty Composition\n\nIn order to face all kinds of challenges in your adventure. Your party should at least contain one Rouge character for lockpicking and trap disarming, one cleric-type character for supporting, healing, and buffing, and one Tank. In the late game, consider multiclassing some of your companions like 11 cleric/1 Wiz to maximize both spellcasting and healing abilities, or Cleric/Bard hybrid for ultimate buff capacity. You can also make 3 thief/9 openhand monk for rogue abilities and decent damage dealing.\n\nRemember, you can always fast-travel to your Camp and change your party composition. You can even use hirelings for buff/healing without cost - simply steal your money back from the Withers, he won't turn hostile.\n\nBasics of Starting a Build BG3\n\nAfter you've made the decision to create a personalized character, the initial step is to choose a Race. There's a sequence of steps provided in the Character Creation menu, but each page might contain a lot of information, which could be overwhelming for new players. So, take it one step at a time, carefully go through all the available details, and select what interests you. Understand that achieving a flawless playthrough might not be possible, and your Companions might not always share your views or even make it through the journey. It's even possible that you won't come up with a Build you're satisfied with on your first attempt. However, Baldur's Gate 3 encourages players to explore various Classes and combinations, especially with the introduction of the new Multiclassing feature and the option to Respec.\n\nChoosing a Race for Beginners in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nThere are a few top things to consider when choosing a race which boils down to the available Race Features, Movement Speed, Proficiencies, and Subraces. The most flexible of these is the available Proficiencies which may then be balanced out with your Class choice. For those who do not mind spoilers or what to look at the whole picture before approaching a build, you can take a look at all available Items, Weapons, and Armor in the game to see what requirements and Proficiency are needed in order to equip the items you want. Your stats and choices will be displayed on the character bar on the left as you go through the different character creation menu options. For the rest of the things to consider, just note that the size and build of each Race will also affect their Movement in the game.\n\nChoosing a Class for Beginners\n\nWhen selecting a Class, it is crucial to take personal interests into account. The Barbarian is strongly recommended for beginners, owing to its highly enjoyable gameplay mechanics. In combat, Barbarians utilize Rage, which provides proficiency in both Melee and Ranged combat. On the other hand, for a more prudent gameplay approach, the Druid Class offers both offensive and supportive capabilities. The options are limitless, but the primary focus should always be on having fun. Flexibility in the game is enhanced by Multiclassing and Respeccing options. This allows players to experiment with different class combinations without needing a complete restart. For comprehensive insights and detailed comparisons of all available classes, refer to the Classes page.\n\nBackgrounds and Proficiencies in BG3\n\nThe variety of Backgrounds will influence your initial Proficiencies. This connects with the concept of Itemization and guides you in determining the Proficiencies necessary for the Items, Equipment, and successful interactions you aim for. Presented below are the selectable Backgrounds, accompanied by their respective Proficiencies.\n\nAcolyte: Insight Proficiency, Religion Proficiency Charlatan: Deception Proficiency, Stealth Proficiency Entertainer: Acrobatics Proficiency, Performance Proficiency Folk Hero: Animal Handling Proficiency, Survival Proficiency Guild Artisan: Insight Proficiency, Persuasion Proficiency Noble: History Proficiency, Persuasion Proficiency Hermit: Medicine Proficiency, Religion Proficiency Outlander: Athletics Proficiency, Survival Proficiency Sage: Arcana Proficiency, History Proficiency Sailor: Athletics Proficiency, Perception Proficiency Soldier: Athletics Proficiency, Intimidation Proficiency Urchin: Sleight of Hand Proficiency, Stealth Proficiency\n\nGuide to Reactions & UI\n\nDungeons and Dragons Concepts\n\nDungeons and Dragons\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 takes its foundation from the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons, a role-playing game system introduced in 2014. Renowned as the most recent iteration of the pen & paper RPG series, the 5th edition offers the framework upon which Baldur's Gate 3 builds its immersive experience.\n\nDungeons and Dragons employs a unique system centered around the d20, a twenty-sided die. This iconic polyhedral instrument is integral to resolving complex encounters and navigating a wide array of scenarios within the vast tapestry of the game world. Dice rolls assume a vital role in every action you undertake, whether it involves engaging in combat or participating in dialogue.\n\nHow Spells Influence Dice Rolls\n\nIn the present configuration, dice rolls are presented at the center of the screen while interacting with NPCs. Your desire is to receive a favorable roll, and with luck, you can actually sway its result. If you're fortunate, you possess the ability to shape its outcome. Employing spells, whether your own or those of your Companions, can enhance the likelihood of NPCs aligning with your perspective. Nevertheless, it's important to bear in mind that casting a spell requires the use of Spell Slots, so prudent selection is advised.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the scenario where you choose to begin by casting Enhance Ability. This initial step takes into account the Advantage bonus, allowing you to roll the dice twice. By doing so, you significantly heighten the likelihood of tilting the odds in your favor. On the other hand, another viable option is to utilize the Guidance spell. This spell, too, serves as an effective choice, elevating your prospects for achieving success.\n\nIn Dungeons & Dragons attributes are called Abilities. This encompasses Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. This can be confusing because every other RPG uses the term abilities to refer to Skills of a character or some other active or passive function they possess.\n\nAbility Score & Ability Modifier\n\nIt's the number that represents each ability stat of your character. On the other hand, ability modifier is the bonus or penalty you gain from your ability score of each ability. To determine an ability modifier, subtract 10 to the ability score, then divide the result by two rounded down. For example. if you have 20 Strength, your ability score is 21. and your ability modifier(21-10=11) is +5 (11/2=5). If you have 6 Wisdom, then your ability Score is 6 (6 - 10 = -4) and your ability modifier is -2. (-4 / 2 = -2)\n\nBoth ability scores and ability modifiers determine how successful your character is at various things throughout the game.\n\nAbility Checks are rolled when performing actions within the game world, testing the character's Abilities and often appear in dialogue. Ability checks are accompanied by something called DC, or Difficulty Class.\n\nDifficulty class is the number you must roll with the d20 to pass the ability check. The task difficulty when performing a DC are:\n\nVery Easy: 5 Easy: 10 Medium: 15 Hard: 20 Very Hard: 25 Nearly Impossible: 30\n\nFor Nearly impossible cases, you have to have a very high ability modifier, other bonuses and almost a perfect 20 roll on the die.\n\nFor example, if you are trying to open a door you cannot open and it has a Strength check DC of 15. Your character has 18 Strength, so he has an Ability modifier +4. So if you try to force it open, you have to roll the d20 and add +4 to that result. If the result is higher than 15, the door will be forced. However, if you should fail the roll nothing or something bad may happen, like for example jamming the door and making it impossible to open.\n\nAll of these operations are calculated by the game automatically, and you can check the results at the bottom of the screen.\n\nAttack rolls occur when a character is attacking another character. The attacking character rolls the d20 and if the roll is equal or higher than the target's Armor Class (AC), then that attack hits the target with the equipped weapon.\n\nMelee weapons use the Strength ability modifier, while Ranged Weapons use the Dexterity ability modifier. There are some exceptions, such as melee weapons that have the finesse property. These melee weapons use Dexterity instead of Strength.\n\nIf you successfully connect the attack, your ability modifier is then added to your damage roll. Damage rolls are calculated by rolling the die or dice of the weapon used and then adding the ability modifier. This means that you are not only more likely to hit with the weapon if you have high Strength or Dexterity, but you will do more damage if you do.\n\nSaving throws are used to calculate the defense of a character against many effects or Spells in the game. Each of these has its own DC, which the character must make a saving throw of the die against in order to protect themselves.\n\nThese Spells or effects will target one of the six Abilities of the player, and they will use that specific ability modifier when rolling. Just like ability checks and attack rolls, you must hit the target number or higher in order to succeed.\n\nIf you are making a spellcasting character, like a Wizard or Sorcerer you want to have the highest DC you can on your Spells because this will make it harder for Enemies to successfully rolling a Saving Throw.\n\nSuch as is the case with Weapons, each Spellcasting class uses a different Ability that is used to calculate the Spellcasting Ability modifier:\n\nClerics use Wisdom Wizards use Intelligence Sorcerers and Warlocks use Charisma\n\nThe DC to resist one of your spells is calculated is always 8 + Spellcasting Ability Modifier.\n\nFor example, if your Druid casts the spell Call Lightning around a bunch of Goblins. The Druid's Wisdom is 23, so he has a Spellcasting Ability Modifier of +6. This means the DC of this Spell is 14 (8+6). Any Goblin who doesn't roll at least draw 14, will take 3d10 damage (The sum of three rolls of a d10 die), and any who does, will take half that amount.\n\nAdvantage and disadvantage\n\nAdvantage and disadvantage are applied to the roll of the d20. Advantage means that you roll the d20 two times when making an Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw, and use the higher of the two values. On the other hand, disadvantage means that you roll the d20 two times but in this case, use the lower of the two values.\n\nAdvantage Example:\n\nAttacking an enemy with following conditions: Restrained, Prone, Sleeping, Entangled, Paralysed, Off balance, Enwebbed, Blinded. Attacking an enemy while Hidden or invisible. Attacking an enemy with the power of high ground. Armor, Weapon Enchantment, and Spells that grant advantage when attacking enemies.\n\nDisadvantage is one of the worst situations you can be on when rolling on D&D, and should be avoided at all costs. While advantage nearly doubles your chance of success and should be sought out.\n\nDisadvantage Example:\n\nAttack an enemy obscured by smoke or darkness Make a ranged attack against an enemy that is within 5ft. Various spells and abilities that grant Disadvantage.\n\nAll characters in D&D 5th edition have what it's called a Proficiency Bonus. This is a positive modifier that increases as your character gains levels, and work somewhat similarly to ability modifiers because it is added to d20 rolls.\n\nEach player character begins the game with a proficiency level of +2, increasing +1 every four levels to a maximum of +6. Proficiency bonus is the same for all characters at the same level, regardless of Class or Race.\n\nProficiency bonus is only added to your d20 rolls of things that you have proficiency in. These are determined by your Race, Class, Background and Feats. This means that you will only get this roll at things your character is good at. For example:\n\nAttack rolls using Weapons you are proficient with. Ability checks using skills you are proficient with. Ability checks using tools you are proficient with. Saving throws you are proficient in Attack rolls with Spells you cast. Saving throws DCs for Spells you cast.\n\nProficiency bonus is not added to the damage roll.\n\nIn 5th edition D&D players do not receive a penalty for attacking with Weapons they are not proficient with, but instead do not gain their proficiency bonus. And when using Armor or Shields they are not proficient with, they have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity and they cannot cast Spells. Using armors you are not proficient with should be avoided at all costs.\n\nSkills are used throughout the game to overcome obstacles. What skills you have and which you are proficient with will be determined during Character Creation, and are usually tied to your Class, Race and Background.\n\nEach skill in the game falls within an ability and are esentially a specific aspect of that ability.\n\nAcrobatics Sleight of Hand Stealth\n\nArcana History Investigation Nature Religion\n\nAnimal Handling Insight Medicine Perception Survival\n\nDeception Intimidation Performance Persuasion\n\nTools are items that can help a player do something they wouldn't otherwise be able to do, they are not tied to a specific ability.\n\nFeats in Baldur's Gate 3 work like talents or perks in other RPGs, giving the character a very specific bonus. Players don't gain Feats automatically. Players gain an Ability Score point every 4 levels (At level 4 - 8 - 12 -16 and finally 19) and can opt out of this ability score improvement to instead take a Feat. Humans and Fighters gain additional Feats.\n\nNot all Feats can be used by everyone, the Heavily Armored Feat for example, requires to have Medium Armor Proficiency to be unlocked.\n\nWeapon Proficiency & Damage Type\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3 you can use any weapon you wish on any character, but you will not gain your proficiency bonus when attacking if you aren't proficient with said weapon. You won't be penalized for using a weapon you are not proficient with, but the likelihood of hitting an enemy is reduced because you don't get the added benefit of proficiency.\n\nEvery characters Weapon proficiency is determined by their Race and Classes. For example, Elves gain proficiency with Longswords, Shortswords, shortbow and longbows. Wizards gain proficiency with Daggers, Darts, Slings, Quarterstaffs and Light Crossbows. This means that if you create an Elven Wizard, you'll have proficiency with all 9 of those weapon types.\n\nEach Weapon has a damage type that is either Bludgeoning, Piercing or Slashing. This is something to be aware of because some Enemies have damage reductions to certain types of damage.\n\nArmor Class (AC)\n\nArmor Class is what protects you from any attack that uses an attack roll, Spells included. The amount of protection you gain depends on how heavy the armor you are wearing is. For example Padded Armor gives you 11 AC, which means an enemy must reach a total of 11 on the attack roll to hit you.\n\nWhen wearing lighter armor, players gain a benefit to their armor class from their Dexterity. When wearing Light Armor you gain the full value of your Dexterity modifier added to your Armor Class. When wearing Medium Armor, you gain up to +2 AC from your Dexterity modifier and when wearing Heavy Armor you gain no benefit from your Dexterity modifier at all.\n\nUnlike Weapons, proficiency in an armor type is a must have or you'll be facing some serious penalties. Characters who wear armor they aren't proficient in will have disadvantage on any Ability Check, Saving Throw or Attack Roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and they can't cast Spells.\n\nThe other two important things to pay attention to when wearing armor, are: whether or not they give you disadvantage on Stealth checks, and when using Heavy Armor whether there is a Strength requirement or not.\n\nWhat is Respeccing and Multiclassing in BG3?\n\nMulticlassing is a feature that will be implemented upon the release of Baldur's Gate 3. This is the ability to switch to another Class or Character and can be done in-game mid-game and will allow players to reallocate some of their scores. In order to allow all different class combinations, Larian removed Ability Score Prerequisites seen in 5e DND. So there's no more need to get your Charisma up to a pesky 13 if you decide to make a soul pact with a playful archfey or dangerous fiend. You can Multiclass into anything your roleplay and build desires demand. In short, this means warriors will be able to wield arcane spells, rogues can master divine magic, spellcasters may dabble in martial prowess, and you’ll have the freedom to build the exact class that you want.\n\nClick on the ground, or hold Left Mouse Button to begin exploring. Your character makes comments as he or she moves throughout the world. This is part of a new point and click system, however you can turn it off or limit the amount of comments if you think it is too much or gets annoying.\n\nBasic Camera Control\n\nHold Middle Mouse Button and move the mouse to rotate the camera. Zoom in or out using Mouse Scroll Up and Mouse Scroll Down. You can also move the camera with W,A,S and D.\n\nPassive Skillchecks\n\nThe game will cast a die based on your Skills to see how your character handles certain risks and mysteries.\n\nUse Jump to reach higher places and jump over obstacles.\n\nHold Left Alt to highlight objects you can interact with.\n\nClearing Surfaces\n\nNote that a surface has been created in your vicinity. Surfaces can be removed by other elements, like fire or water.\n\nDestructible Environment\n\nSome parts of the environment are destructible. Press Left Ctrl to target and object for attack. Some objects also take damage from Spells and Missiles.\n\nLocked doors and containers can be opened with keys. Some can also be lockpicked with Thieves' Tools or destroyed with Spells, Missiles, or manual attacks.\n\nComplex locks will require higher skill in Sleight of Hand.\n\nUse Hide C to begin sneaking. Red vision cones indicate where characters are looking. Hide in dark areas (indicated by an icon at your mouse cursor). If you are not hidden, crossing a vision cone will immediately reveal you. Passing through a vision cone while hidden prompts a Stealth check - a failure reveals you.\n\nCreating Torches\n\nEquip a torch and Dip it in a fire surface to light up the dark.\n\nMerchants refresh stock\n\nMerchants in BG3 refresh their stock every time a character in your team level up, or take a long rest.\n\nMoving and Stacking Objects\n\nMany objects in the world can be moved and stacked on top of one another by clicking and dragging them. Climb objects by right-clicking.\n\nPress I to access your inventory\n\nTo equip an item, open your Character Sheet with N and left-click on the matching equipment slot. You can also right click on an item from within your inventory to immediately equip it.\n\nPreparing Spells\n\nSpellcasters can only use prepared spells. Change which spells you have prepared any time outside of combat.\n\nUse the Throw Skill to throw targets you are strong enough to hold. Thrown targets can cause damage. Some can create surfaces.\n\nThrowing Potions\n\nMost Potions can work if you simply throw it on other characters. For example, if you throw a Potion of Healing on a companion, then he or she will be healed. Works better if you stick your team members together and use one potion to cure the entire team. (In order to place all your party members close enough, unlink all of them, then move them to same spot. All your characters will then ignore collision and stand together.)\n\nCarry a candle for weapon dip\n\nYou can always carry a candle, place it before combats, and use it for weapon dip. Extra fire damage can make a lot of early-game combats much easier.\n\nThe Dash action allows you to double your movement speed.\n\nUse Shove to get a target out of your way or to move an ally to safety. This is a bonus Action.\n\nInspecting Characters\n\nExamine characters using Right Mouse Button to learn about their Strengths and weaknesses. Most useful before and during combat.\n\nIt's important to heal after a fight. Certain Potions, Spells and Food can heal you. On this Nautiloid, Restoration stations can also heal you.\n\nAdvantage Positioning\n\nFor Ranged attacks, gain Advantage by shooting from higher ground. Shooting from lower ground that your target gives you Disadvantage. For light melee weapons, gain advantage by gettinf behind your foes to backstab them.\n\nPress L to read your Journal\n\nFollowers are temporary companions and have limited interactions\n\nPress Home to center the camera on your selected character.\n\nThis game uses dice to determine outcomes. The dice are referred to as 'd' + a number indicating the number of sides on the dice. For example, 'd6' indicates a standard six-sided dice. Other dice used are d4, d8, d10, d12 and d20.\n\nDeath Saving Throws\n\nWhen a character's HP reaches 0, they must roll a die to stay alive (Death Saving Throw). The character rolls a die each turn. Each roll either succeeds or fails. After three successes, the character is stabilized. After three failures, the character is dead. Characters can be saved by their allies by being healed, or if someone uses the Help action on them during Death Saving Throws. Stabilized characters still need an ally to use the Help action on them.\n\nUse the dip action to dip your equipped weapon into a surface, giving it bonuses. For example, dipping your weapon in fire will give it fire damage.",
