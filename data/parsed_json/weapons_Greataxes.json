  "content": "Greataxes in Baldur's Gate 3 are pieces of equipment that are used to inflict damage against hostile characters such as Enemies and Bosses. Greataxes are Two-Handed Martial Weapons in BG3 that can only be two-handed, dealing 1-12 Damage without enchantments. They have a range of 1.5m, and they deal Slashing Damage, though some special Greataxes also deal another type of Damage as well. The exception to this is the Cultist Brand, which deals 1-8 Bludgeoning Damage instead.\n\nMany Greataxes have unique properties, so you should read carefully what these do, and many also have Weapon Actions that can only be used if you are Proficient with Greataxes in BG3. These Weapon Actions are Cleave, Lacerate, and Prepare.\n\nBattleaxes Clubs Daggers Darts Flails Glaives Greataxes Greatclubs Greatswords Halberds Handaxes Hand Crossbows Heavy Crossbows Javelins Light Crossbows Light Hammers Longbows Longswords Maces Mauls Morningstars Pikes Quarterstaves Rapiers Scimitars Shortbows Shortswords Sickles Spears Tridents War Picks Warhammers\n\nAll Greataxes in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nName Damage Special Properties Weapon Actions Cultist Brand 1d8 Bludgeoning None None Greataxe 1d12 Slashing None CleaveLaceratePrepare Bloodsoaked Greataxe 1d12 +1 Slashing Weapon Enchantment +1 CleaveLaceratePrepare Bloodrender Doom Axe 1d12 Slashing Edge of Terror: Each strike fills target with a chilling dread that prevents it from regaining hit points.
