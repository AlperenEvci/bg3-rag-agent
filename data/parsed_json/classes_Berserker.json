They have proficiency with Simple Weapons, martial weapons, light Armor, medium armor and shields.\n\nThe Berserker subclass is a path within the Barbarian class in Dungeons & Dragons and Baldur's Gate 3. It emphasizes unrestrained fury and heightened offensive capabilities, transforming the Barbarian into a relentless and devastating force on the battlefield.\n\nThe defining feature of the Berserker subclass is the ability to enter a Frenzy while raging. When choosing to do so as a bonus action, the Barbarian gains an additional attack during each of their turns while they are in a rage.

At level 3, the Berserker unlocks Frenzy. Once activated, the Berserker can perform two new actions. Frenzied Strike and Enraged Throw. The former is a bonus action that allows the Berserker to attack with their melee weapon, but it also earns them a stack of Strain, which causes the Barbarian to suffer -1 to hit on all attacks per stack. The latter allows Berserkers to pick up an item or creature and throw it at a target, dealing Bludgeoning damage and knocking it Prone. Note that the strength of the Barbarian determines the amount of weight that can be thrown. Heavier items or characters, deal more damage. At level 6, the Berserker learns Mindless Rage which makes the Berserker's frenzy immune to outside influence. This renders the berserker immune to Charmed or Frightened, while raging. Neither Calm Emotions can't end your rage. At level 10, the Berserker learns Intimidating Presence an action that can instill fear on a target, by menacing them. It is not a great ability and many barbarian players, decide to multiclass at level 9 to earn other Classes features and abilities.
