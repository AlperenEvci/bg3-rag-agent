The Ranger's primary is Dexterity, their Saving Throw proficiencies are Strength & Dexterity and they have a Hit Dice of 1d10. They have proficiency with Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons, Shields, Light Armour, and Medium Armour.\n\nThe Ranger class is a classic character from Dungeons & Dragons and has been a part of Baldur's Gate 3 since Early Access. Today, Rangers continue to explore the world of Faerun with their superior hunting skills and natural ability to thrive in the harshest, wildest climates, amidst the flora and the fauna.\n\nRangers are traditionally regarded as simple characters able to traverse the wilds with their timeless weapon of choice - the bow and arrow. In Baldur's Gate 3, Rangers are able to take a step further, mastering their control over wild beasts, completing their skills of the hunt, and even tempering themselves in the darkest environments, eventually learning how to go beyond the material and cast specialized Spells.\n\nRangers have their own list of Spells and Features accessible to them through leveling up the character. They have the option to choose their path to undertake once they reach Level 3.\n\nRangers are unrivalled scouts and trackers, honing a deep connection with nature in order to hunt their favoured prey.\n\nBG3 Ranger Class Features\n\nHit Points at 1st level: 10 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 6 + Constitution modifier\n\nArmor: Light Armour, Medium Armour, Shields Weapons: Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity Skills: Choose any 3 Skills from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, Survival\n\nSTARTING EQUIPMENT\n\nLeather Armour, Leather Boots Shortbow, Arrow of Ice Health Potion x2, Scroll of Revivify\n\nRANGER SPELLCASTING\n\nHalf Spellcasters: Gains spellcasting at level 2.

Beast Master summons is limited to Bear, Boar, Dire Raven, Wolf, or Wolf Spider. Choose Beastmaster for a summoned animal companion or Gloomstalker for enhanced mobility and bonus damage on your first turn. After obtaining Extra Attack at Ranger Level 5, it may be best to invest further levels into another class, as Ranger is notoriously weak at later levels. A good secondary class for Ranger would be Fighter for the addition of a a self heal through Second Wind, an additional set of Actions through Action Surge, and a list of benefits through the Champion subclass.
