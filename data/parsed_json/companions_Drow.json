Drows can wield both melee and ranged weapons. While creating your Character in Baldur's Gate 3, you can choose between 11 different types of races. Each of them has their special characteristics.\n\nBG3 Full Game Note: In the full launch of Baldur's Gate 3, Ability Score Points for Races that were present in Early Access are removed. And instead, Ability Score Points in the full game correspond with the Class players will choose.\n\nDriven to the Underdark, most drow have adopted a ruthless pragmatism. While the Lolth-sworn delight in the goddess' evil tenets, the Seldarine reject Her attempt to overthrow the leader of the elven pantheon.\n\nDrow Traits & Features in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nBase Racial Speed: You can move 9m per turn. Drow Weapon Training: You have Proficiency with the Rapier, Shortsword, and Hand Crossbow . Fey Ancestry: You have Advantage on Saving Throws against being Charmed, and magic can't put you to Sleep. Superior Darkvision: Can see in the dark up to 24m. Keen Senses: You have Proficiency with Perception. Drow Magic: Gain access to the following spells using Charisma as the Spellcasting Ability: At Level 1: Dancing Lights: Create wisps of light that illuminate a 9m radius. At Level 3: Faerie Fire: Encase multiple targets in colorful light. The targets turns visible, and attack rolls against the targets have advantage. Ignores allies with the Sculpt Spells feature. Once per Long Rest. At Level 5: Darkness: Create a cloud of magical darkness to Heavily Obscure and Blind creatures within. Creatures cannot make ranged attacks into or out of the darkness. Once per Long Rest.\n\nAt Level 1: Dancing Lights: Create wisps of light that illuminate a 9m radius. At Level 3: Faerie Fire: Encase multiple targets in colorful light.

Expect more frequent NPC reactions to your race. During Early Access, the Drow race used to feature +2 Dexterity and +1 Charisma. This has been changed in the full launch of BG3 and the Ability Score points are now associated with the Class that players will choose.\n\nRaces and Subraces Asmodeus Tiefling ♦ Black Dragonborn ♦ Blue Dragonborn ♦ Brass Dragonborn ♦ Bronze Dragonborn ♦ Copper Dragonborn ♦ Deep Gnome ♦ Drow Half-Elf ♦ Duergar ♦ Dwarf ♦ Elf ♦ Forest Gnome ♦ Githyanki ♦ Gnome ♦ Gold Dragonborn ♦ Gold Dwarf ♦ Green Dragonborn ♦ Half-Drow ♦ Half-Elf ♦ Halfling ♦ High Elf ♦ High Half-Elf ♦ Human ♦ Lightfoot Halfling ♦ Lolth-Sworn Drow ♦ Mephistopheles Tiefling ♦ Red Dragonborn ♦ Rock Gnome ♦ Seldarine Drow ♦ Shield Dwarf ♦ Silver Dragonborn ♦ Strongheart Halfling ♦ Tiefling ♦ White Dragonborn ♦ Wood Elf ♦ Wood Half-Elf ♦ Zariel Tiefling",
