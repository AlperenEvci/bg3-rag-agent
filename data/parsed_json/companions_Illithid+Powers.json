  "content": "Illithid Powers, also known as Tadpole Powers, are a type of special ability in Baldur's Gate 3. Illithid Powers are tied to the Mind Flayer tadpole implanted in the heads of the player character and Origin Companions at the beginning of the game. Some Illithid Powers are available to all classes, while others are class-specific.\n\nHow to unlock Illithid Powers in BG3\n\nIllithid Powers are acquired by selecting [ILLITHID] [WISDOM] dialogue choices when interacting with other NPCs, usually those who are also infected by an Illithid tadpole, but disciples of The Absolute also tend to trigger these dialog options. Once the player has succeeded on 3 Illithid Wisdom Ability Checks, the next Long Rest they take will trigger a dream cutscene (the trigger for this dream may also be related to the cutscene seen in the Goblin Camp). If the player choses to make use of their parasite in the dream, they can then consume any Mind Flayer Parasite Specimens they may have collected. This will trigger another cutscene about consuming the Tadpoles, after which any future parasite specimens the player finds will be added directly to the Illithid Powers tab in the Character Sheet.\n\nHow do Illithid Powers work in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nAfter obtaining an Illithid Tadpole from other infected NPCs, you can spend them to unlock an Illithid Power of your choice in the Illithid Power Menu by pressing B. This menu is set up similarly to a skill tree - Illithid Powers in the outer ring of the 'tree' can only be unlocked after unlocking those adjacent to it in the inner rings. Illithid Powers with grey icons are passive skills, while those with red icons are active skills. Once in the Illithid Power menu, click and drag a tadpole from the top right corner into the skill you want to unlock. You will have the Illithid Persuasion unlocked for free.\n\nIt should be noted that some Illithid Powers were class-restricted in the Early Access version of the game. In the final release of Baldur's Gate 3, this restriction was lifted, and all Illithid Powers are usable by any class.\n\nClick for zoomed version of picture above\n\nAll Illithid Powers in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nNote: Let your main character use the Zaith'Isk in the Githyanki infirmary and succeed at all three saving throws grants you Awakened permanent status. Your illithid powers will cost bonus action instead of standard action.\n\nQuick Search of All Illithid Powers in Baldur's Gate 3:\n\nPower Name Type Description Prerequisite Favorable Beginnings Feature The first Attack Roll or Ability Check you make against any target gains a bonus equal to your Proficiency bonus.

Each parasite consumed unlocks one new Illithid Power within a skill tree of 25 powerful mind-flayer-inspired abilities, completely separate to the options you have when you level up in a traditional sense. These are divided into five branches themed around manipulation, health restoration, psionics, and abilities that can inflict immense damage and torment enemies to gradually weaken them over time. Some abilities can be used to control those around you, pushing them to say things in dialogue they would otherwise not. Others endow you with the power to push and pull enemies like ragdolls during battle. Tadpoles locations in Baldur's Gate 3 You can collect additional Mind Flayer tadpoles to advance your Illithid Powers, here is a list of where you can find more tadpoles: Tadpoles in Act 1 One can be found on the dead True Soul in Forest (X139, Y444), do not resist the tadpole to acquire.

Tadpoles in Act 2 One can be found by defeating Fist Marcus. Three can be found in the Infirmary of Crèche Y'llek, next to the Zaith'isk. One can be found on Linsella, in the Moonrise Towers kitchen.
