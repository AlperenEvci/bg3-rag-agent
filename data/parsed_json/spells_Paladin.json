A Paladin's primary Ability is Strength, their Saving Throw proficiencies are Wisdom & Charisma and they have a Hit Dice of 1d10 per paladin level. They have proficiency with Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons, and all Armor and Shields.\n\nThe Paladin class offers an excellent experience for roleplaying, as players can experience changing their subclass through their subsequent actions. Players will face scenarios where they will be tempted to embrace the dark side, as they struggle to uphold their Oaths and deal with the consequences of being branded as an Oathbreaker. For Paladins, their Oaths are sacred to them, and this is why they can choose their subclass immediately on Character Creation.\n\nIn combat, Paladins are able to provide great support to their allies that can help them gain an edge in battle. Oathbreakers will have the same abilities as their original Subclass but will gain new and sinister capabilities.\n\nFuelled by the Oaths you swore to uphold justice and righteousness, you are a beacon of hope in dark times.\n\nBG3 Paladin Class Features\n\nHit Points at 1st level: 10 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 6 + Constitution modifier\n\nArmor: Light Armour, Medium Armour, Heavy Armour, Shields Weapons: Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma Skills: Choose 2 Skills from - Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, Religion\n\nSTARTING EQUIPMENT\n\nScale Mail, Leather Boots Warhammer, Wooden Shield, Javelin x2 Health Potion x2, Scroll of Revivify\n\nPALADIN SPELLCASTING\n\nHalf Spellcasters: Gains spellcasting at level 2.

Performing any actions that break your Oath will summon the Oathbreaker Knight who will be waiting for you at your camp, talk to him to learn about Oathbreaking and, if you so desire, unlocks the Oathbreaker subclass. Becoming an Oathbreaker replaces the Channel Oath abilities and Spells from your previous Oath with new exclusive abilities and spells for the Oathbreaker.\n\nIf you want to restore your old Oath, speak to the Oathbreaker Knight in your Camp. He will offer to restore your Oath for a fee of 1000gp. (This price will increase if you break your Oath again. )\n\nBG3 Paladin Tenets\n\nOath of the Ancients\n\nKindle the Light.

Paladins benefit from Divine Smite for increased damage output. Be sure to setup your Reactions so that you can just melee attack, and use Divine Smite if you want. To do this, hit \"L\" on the keyboard and tick each level of Divine Smite \"On\" and to \"Ask\". This will allow you to use Divine Smite with other Weapon Actions, Opportunity Attacks, as well as Smite Spells. Using the Dueling fighting style maximizes damage while using a one-handed weapon and a shield. Duelling is particularly good if you are out of Spell Slots and cannot Divine Smite. Defence is also a great choice of Fighting Style since most Paladin damage comes from Divine Smite anyway. Oath of Vengeance subclass offers more versatility for making morally ambiguous decisions, while Oathbreaker allows the player to choose whatever decisions he or she wants, both good and evil. Multiclassing at level 2 or 6 are ideal for Paladin because at level 2 you can bring Divine Smite and all your Proficiencies to another Class, while at level 6 you gain Extra Attack and Aura of Protection, which are both fantastic. Paladins in BG3 use Charisma for Aura of Protection, and Dialogue mostly, but it does increase they number of Spells they can Prepare. There are very few hostile Paladin Spells that require high Charisma though, so don't pump Charisma thinking you will need it for these types of Spells unless you know which they are and you've planned ahead. You can completely dump Dexterity and use Heavy Armour for protection on your Paladin, and you won't gain the -1 penalty to AC at 8 DEX thanks to the way Heavy Armour works. Remember that Duelling doesn't work with Versatile Weapons unless paired with a shield, so using a Longsword alone is not ideal on a Paladin using this Fighting Style. Extra Attack only provides a second Attack if you used your Action to Attack to begin with. You cannot cast a spell and then attack, or attack and then cast a spell. And, Extra Attack doesn't stack with other Classes that have Extra Attack.\n\nAll Paladin Spells in Baldurs Gate 3\n\nYou can search by Name, Level, School and Casting Time.
