  "content": "Companion Approval in Baldur's Gate 3 are the opinions your Companions make based on the choices you make throughout the game. Players can forge deep connections with the various Companions they encounter to have a positive or a negative opinion, these choices can range from acts of heroism to acts of cruelty, and each decision is met with a corresponding reaction from your Companions. There are various outcomes that could happen with your Companions such as Romancing, and being abandoned or killed by your Companion.\n\nThis page contains a play-by-play per dialogue line that provides approval/disapproval. Extremely detailed spoilers after this point.\n\nCompanion Approval Guide for Baldur's Gate 3\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Companion Approval Information\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 features a companion approval system that adds depth and complexity to the game's narrative and character interactions. As players progress, you will recruit a diverse cast of characters to join your party, each with their own unique personalities, motivations, and backstories. These companions not only provide valuable assistance during combat encounters but also play a crucial role in shaping the overarching story.\n\nThe companion approval system is based on the concept of approval and disapproval, with each character being constantly influenced by the player's actions and choices. How players handle certain situations, interact with NPCs, or resolve conflicts will directly impact their companions' perception of them.\n\nIt is important to note that the companion approval system in Baldur's Gate 3 goes beyond a simple binary \"good or bad\" metric. Each companion has their own unique set of values and morals, and what one companion might see as a positive trait, another may see as negative. This adds a layer of complexity and depth to the choices players make, forcing them to carefully consider the consequences and potential impact on their companions' opinions\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Romance Explained\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Companion Approval Guide\n\nHigh vs Low Companion Approval in BG3\n\nHigh companion approval often leads to improved relationships, resulting in companions becoming more loyal, supportive, and effective in combat or other relevant tasks. Increased approval ratings might unlock new quests, dialog options, or even romantic relationships, enhancing the overall gaming experience.\n\nLow companion approval could lead to dissatisfaction, conflicts, or even abandonment from the Companion, potentially removing important allies or reducing certain quest opportunities. Negative actions or decisions might impact the player's reputation in the game, affecting interactions with other NPCs.\n\nIncreasing Companion Approval in BG3\n\nPlayers will need to act in line with the companions' values, beliefs, and aspirations. Pay attention to their personal quests, back stories, and dialogs to understand their preferences better. Frequently engaging in conversations with Companions, asking about their opinions, thoughts, and experiences will help deepen the relationship and gain insights to their likes and dislikes. Make choices in their personal quests or missions, showing genuine interest and investment in their stories and goals.\n\nPlayers can also offer gifts or complete favors for your companions to improve approval ratings, paying attention to their specific interests or desires for more effective gift giving.\n\nConflicting Companion Approvals in BG3\n\nIn some cases, players might experience having multiple companions whose approval choices conflict with one another, balancing these conflict approvals can be tricky wince decisions that please one companion may upset another.\n\nConsider the consequences of your actions and make choices based on your own values or the long-term goals of your playthrough. Utilizing dialog options and actions that aim to find compromises, pacify tensions, or even resolve conflicts.\n\nCompanion Character Development in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nAs you progress further, due to player choices the companions themselves will start to develop. Larian has painstakingly put a tremendous effort of branching companion morality.\n\nFor example Gale can have his morality twisted. If you choose to side with the goblins and unlike Karlach and Wyll, he will not leave your party automatically. Talking to him during the Goblin Party where he will threaten to leave for participating in the massacre of the Refugees. You can convince him to change his morality by justifying his participation was because of his need for survival and effectively stopping him from leaving the party and at the same time twisting his moral compass.\n\nMax Companion Approval in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nWhen you max out Companion Approval to Exceptional, you will stop gaining Approval Notifications.\n\nIt should therefore be noted post Act 1, if you follow the guide then you most likely maxed your preferred companion Approval. Thus there would be situations or choices that may improve your approval but the game does not show.\n\nDistance and Approval in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nCompanions have a certain distance they need to be in earshot in order to gain approval. Be too far and the Companion will not gain approval. If you leave a companion in camp and out of party, they would also not be able to gain approval or disapproval. The same idea can be said about acts in the Camp (Volo's Surgery). There events in camp for example like Karlach's first conflict with Wyyll. Allows for every companion to react and thus gain or lose approval.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Dialog Scenarios Quick Navigation\n\nClick to jump to a specific section of the page\n\nRavaged Beach/ Nautiloid Crash site\n\nScenario Details Approval Disapproval Related NPC Sub- Location Open Shadowhearts' pod while on the Nautiloid Escape the Nautiloid Rescue the Illithid's Captive Requirements/Details: Finish the Rescue the Illithid's Captive by unlocking the Mindflayer pod.
