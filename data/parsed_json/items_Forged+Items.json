  "content": "Forged Items in Baldur's Gate 3 features items that can be Crafted using the Adamantine Forge at Grymforge. These items require Mithral Ore and a specific Mould for the desired item to be crafted. The Forge can be found in Grymforge (X: -569 Y: 252), and it must be activated first by placing a Mithral Ore in the Crucible and a Mould in the Mould Chamber. and then pulling the lever that hammers down the crucible. If you pull the lever without placing any items, the crucible will still be hammered, but the crucible won't be activated. If the whole platforms lowers down, this means that the forge was successfully activated.\n\nThe Adamantine Forge quest can be activated by talking to the Duergars found in Grymforge, mining boulders that are blocking a path. If you play your card correctly, the Duergar will reveal you that there's an Adamantine Forge that they are looking for. Follow The Adamantine Forge quest guide to complete the quest and find the forge.\n\nThe Adamantine Forge\n\nOnce the forge is activated, follow the next steps to forge an item in the Adamantine Forge.\n\nPlace the Mithral Ore in the Crucible. (Note there's only 2 Mithral Ore in game. ) Place the desired Mould in the Mould Chamber. Near the corner you can find a valve. Pull this valve, the level of lava will rise and you will be able to walk only over the circular platforms. The Grym will wake up and start a battle against you. Pull the lever that hammers the crucible like an anvil. Note If the grym automaton doesn't die specifically on top of the crucible, the lever jams and you can only craft the item that you put in before the combat.\n\nAfter completing this, by opening the Mould Chamber, you will find the forged item. The only item lost in this process is the Mithral Ore, but you will be able to recover the Mould in case you want to forge an item repeatedly.\n\nGrym in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nOnce you pull the valve, a Construct named Grym will wake up and start to battle against your party. The Grym is resistant or immune to almost every type of damage and it has a large pool of life, so it's not recommended to combat against it directly.\n\nThe best way to defeat the Grym, is to bait it to walk over the crucible, and pull the lever that hammers it. Prepare your party for the battle before rising the level of lava. Place at least one member your party next to the lever and be ready to pull it. The rest of your party, specially the one that pulled the lava valve, should bait the Grym to the center.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Forged Items\n\nQuick Search of All Forged Items\n\nClick the header to sort the table.\n\nForged Item Effect Mould Ore Adamantine Scimitar The holder of this item gains: Swift Hitter Equip item in main hand to gains: Flourish Bonus ActionLacerate Action Scimitar Mould Mithral Ore Adamantine Splint Armour Reduces all incoming damage by 2.
