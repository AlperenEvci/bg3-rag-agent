The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action only when a Special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a Bonus Action. You otherwise don’t have a Bonus Action to take.\n\nYou can take only one Bonus Action on Your Turn, so you must choose which Bonus Action to use when you have more than one available.\n\nYou choose when to take a Bonus Action during Your Turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take Actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus Action.\n\nBonus Action in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nName Type Description Range Requirements Jump Bonus Action Characters perform a jump, which distance depends on his or her Strength modifier.
