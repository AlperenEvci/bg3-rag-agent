  "content": "Advantage is a mechanic in Baldur's Gate 3 that allows players to roll two D20s instead of one when making ability checks, saving throws, or attack rolls. The higher of these two rolls determines the outcome. Disadvantage works in the opposite way - you roll two D20s but must use the lower result.\n\nAdvantage and Disadvantage\n\nAdvantage and disadvantage are applied to the roll of the d20. Advantage means that you roll the d20 two times when making an Attack Roll, Ability Check or Saving Throw, and use the higher of the two values. On the other hand, disadvantage means that you roll the d20 two times but in this case, use the lower of the two values. Disadvantage is one of the worst situations you can be on when rolling on D&D, and should be avoided at all costs. While advantage nearly doubles your chance of success and should be sought out.\n\nHow to get Advantage How to get Disadvantage Attacking an enemy while being hidden or invisible. Attacking a Prone or Sleeping enemy within 3/1.5m. Attacking an enemy that is Blinded, Entangled or Paralyzed. Various other spells and abilities that grant Advantage. Making a ranged attack while an enemy is in melee distance. Attacking an enemy obscured by darkness or invisible. Attacking an enemy outside range (18m+). Wearing armour or using a shield you are not proficient in. Being Blinded, Poisoned or Frightened. Various other spells and abilities that grant Disadvantage. Attack an enemy from lower ground.\n\nAttacking an enemy while being hidden or invisible. Attacking a Prone or Sleeping enemy within 3/1.5m.

If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\n\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both Advantage and Disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one D20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.",
