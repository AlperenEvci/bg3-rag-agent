  "content": "Respec in Baldur's Gate 3, is a game mechanic that completely resets a character. Respec allows players to \"reset\" their playable character, granting them the possibility to change many of the starting choices made during Character Creation. Players can use this service in order to try out different Builds, trying different Classes, or choosing a new Subclass, among many other things. Respecing in Baldur's Gate 3 is done through the character Withers, an undead skeleton that can be found early in the game.\n\nHow many times can a Character be Respeced?\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, players can respec their characters as many times as they want. As long as they have the required gold and have already added Withers to the Camp. They can approach him and select respec among the services he provides. He asks for 100 gold pieces for this service. The price of the service DOES NOT increase during the course of the game, nor if you use it frequently. It remains the same throughout the game.\n\nWhat can be changed by Respecing?\n\nYou can change anything related to Class and Abilities. You CANNOT change your Race or Subrace. You can change:\n\nClasses and Subclasses (Only if available at lvl 1) Cantrips available Spells available Actions or Class Features Abilities\n\nWhich Characters can be Respeced?\n\nAny character can interact with Withers to Respec. Even your Companions, can change their Class if they pay the asking price. Note that respecing a character does not change its interactions or Quests. It only influences the Class and all choices derived from it (Such as Cantrips, Spells, Actions, Abilities, etc). This allows players to change the Classe of any Companion to better suit your playstyle, and grants further customization for team compositions.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Respec Guide\n\nWhere to find Withers\n\nWithers is the Npc in charge of Respecing, among a few other useful services. He can be found at the end of the Dank Crypt, an area which players can access early into the game.\n\nPlayers can enter the Crypt in the area of the Ravaged Beach, called Chapel Entrance. There is a group of Bandits discussing outside, and players have to manage their way through to enter the Crypt, either by fighting or by convincing the adventurers that they should leave the area. As soon as you approach the bandits, you will earn the quest Explore the Ruins.\n\nOnce inside, players will find the other part of the bandits that were posted outside. Fight them to pass through. Head to the room with the big statue, and move behind it to pass a Perception check that uncovers a lever. Activate it to open a secret door in the previous room. Enter the new area and you will reach the Dank Crypt. There are two doors, one on each side of the area. Head to the one on the right first. It has as sarcophagus in the middle, and by passing Perception Checks, you will notice a big amount of traps in the area. In a column there is a button which resets the traps. (You will also need a perception check in order to see it). Once you loot the Sarcophagus, the traps will activate so, be ready to press the button as fast as possible or put heavy objects on top of the vents on the ground before looting. Regardless, you will find The Watcher's Guide, and the Engraved Key. Now head to the left door and use the Engraved Key to open it. Past the dead Scribes, you will have to get near a certain area (X: -298, Y: -232, approx), to trigger a Perception Check. If you pass it, a button will appear, press it to open a hidden door. The Dead Scribes will fight you. Defeat them, enter the area, open the Sarcophagus and talk to Withers. After a small conversation, he will appear in your camp the next time you head there to rest. Talk to him and eventually you will be able to ask for the Respec service, for 100 gold coins.",
