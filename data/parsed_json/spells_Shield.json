You take no damage from Magic Missile. School: Abjuration School Casting Time: Reaction Range: Self Requires Concentration: No Saving Throw: None\n\nHow to Acquire Shield\n\nShield can be acquired by the following classes: Sorcerer, Wizard, Eldritch Knight, Hexblade Shield can be cast by using the following Items: Amulet of the Harpers Elegant Studded Leather ???\n\nSorcerer, Wizard, Eldritch Knight, Hexblade\n\nAmulet of the Harpers Elegant Studded Leather ???\n\nShield Tips & Notes\n\nEven at Wizard Level 1, this Spell is incredibly reliable, and is a solid choice for when Multi-Classing into a single Level of Wizard, which one might do if only for the ability to learn other Spells from Scrolls. It is best cast at the lowest level possible, as it gains no further benefits from upcasting. 'Shield' is a very strong spell, it is usually always worth sacrificing a spell slot for it as a reaction, as when successful; ontop of mitigating damage taken, you also forgo the risk of breaking any Concentration you might be holding. It is recommended to set your 'Shield' caster's Attack of Opportunity reaction to either 'disabled' or 'ask'; as you only have one reaction per turn. AI enemies increase in difficult by beginning to likely prioritize easier to hit targets with lower health than the closest target to them, in Tactician Mode this is the case from the beginning to the end of the game. Because of this, if your Wizard/Sorcerer have higher health that contest other Playable Characters and higher AC than them, they are unlikely to be selected as a target by the AI to attack, when you cast Shield this will cause the enemy to prioritize other targets to avoid constantly missing. Shield can also be found on some items that can be used once per Long Rest and can be casted by anyone who wear it as a reaction, AC can scale really high in the later acts of 2 and 3 up to 21-23 AC, and increasing it to 26-28 makes you downright impossible, especially if you are the only valid target to hit thanks to either you allies hiding or have Sanctuary applied to them and on top of applying Disadvantages on the enemy in other means.\n\nLvl 1 Spells Animal Friendship ♦ Armour of Agathys ♦ Arms of Hadar ♦ Bane ♦ Bless ♦ Burning Hands ♦ Challenge to Duel ♦ Charm Person ♦ Chromatic Orb ♦ Chromatic Orb: Acid (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Cold (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Fire (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Lightning (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Poison (Lvl 1) ♦ Chromatic Orb: Thunder (Lvl 1) ♦ Colour Spray ♦ Command (Halt) ♦ Compelled Duel ♦ Create or Destroy Water ♦ Create Water ♦ Cure Wounds ♦ Disguise Self ♦ Dissonant Whispers ♦ Divine Favour ♦ Enhance Leap ♦ Ensnaring Strike ♦ Entangle ♦ Expeditious Retreat ♦ Faerie Fire ♦ False Life ♦ Feather Fall ♦ Find Familiar ♦ Find Familiar: Cat ♦ Find Familiar: Crab ♦ Find Familiar: Frog ♦ Find Familiar: Rat ♦ Find Familiar: Raven ♦ Find Familiar: Spider ♦ Fog Cloud ♦ Goodberry ♦ Grease ♦ Guiding Bolt ♦ Hail of Thorns ♦ Healing Word ♦ Hellish Rebuke ♦ Heroism ♦ Hex ♦ Hunter's Mark ♦ Inflict Wounds ♦ Jump ♦ Longstrider ♦ Mage Armour ♦ Magic Missile ♦ Protection from Evil and Good ♦ Ray of Sickness ♦ Sanctuary ♦ Searing Smite (Spell) ♦ Shield of Faith ♦ Sleep ♦ Speak with Animals ♦ Tasha's Hideous Laughter ♦ Thunderous Smite ♦ Thunderwave ♦ Witch Bolt ♦ Wrathful Smite",
