Find Arabella's Parents can be acquired during Act 2 and you will be looking for Komira and Locke, the parents of Arabella. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earn more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nFind Arabella's Parents Objectives\n\nSearch for Arabella's Parents.\n\nWe met Arabella, a tiefling child from the grove, in the shadow-cursed lands. She was looking for her parents. We offered to search for them, and invited her to our camp.\n\nTell Arabella about her parents.\n\nWe found Arabella's parents - dead. We should break the news to her at camp.\n\nCheck up on Arabella.\n\nArabella was very upset when we broke the news to her about her parents. We should check up on her once she's had some time to process the news.\n\nWithers encouraged Arabella to learn the ways of the Weave. She left to find her own way in the world.\n\nFind Arabella's Parents Walkthrough\n\nAfter unlocking the quest by speaking to Arabella, she will go wait in camp until you find her parents. They can be found in the eastern wing of the House of Healing infirmary, being \"attended\" to by one of the sisters. Talk to the sister watching over them to progress the quest.\n\nAfter speaking to the sister and discovering the untimely demise of Arabella's parents, you can break the news to Arabella the next time you return to camp. You can either tell her that her parents are dead and you found their corpses, or that you haven't found them yet. Telling her that you've found them dead will gain the approval of Astarion, Gale, Shadowheart, and Wyll. Arabella will say she doesn't believe you, and will make you leave.\n\nAfter a long rest, interact with her again. She will initially still be in disbelief that her parents are dead. Withers tells her that she must accept her fate, causing Arabella to rage and emit a burst of uncontrolled magic. Withers manages to calm her down, and tells her that she must find the balance within herself. He remarks that while she needs to learn the ways of the arcane, she must find her own way and cannot stay in camp with you.\n\nYour next set of choices will look like this:\n\nWhere will she go, then? Why not? I'm not sending her out there alone. Fine with me. She's already outstayed her welcome.\n\nWithers will go on to explain that Arabella holds a power beyond reckoning, but that her power is currently unbalanced. When Arabella asks if Withers is making her leave, he tells her not to worry as the Weave knows her purpose and will guide her. Your next set of choices will look like this:\n\nYou can trust Withers. If he says you'll be safe, you should believe him. I'm sorry. I wish it could be different. I'm not going to make you go away. Leave.\n\nIf you choose the first option, Arabella's grief will fade and there will be \"a lightness in her now.\" After your conversation, you will have completed the quest Find Arabella's Parents. She will reward you with the Shadow Blade Ring.\n\nHow to unlock Find Arabella's Parents\n\nSpeak to Arabella in Reithwin Town. You can find her on the north side of town between the Mason's Guild and the House of Healing, just outside the gates to the cemetery. There will be two winged lion statues, one of them fallen.\n\nFind Arabella's Parents Rewards\n\nShadow Blade Ring\n\nFind Arabella's Parents Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
