Druids in wild shapes can't cast verbal Spells while Silenced. Unlike in normal D&D 5e, there is no time limit on how long the Druids can retain their Wild Shape. Unlike in normal D&D 5e, there are no restrictions upon the type of armour Druids may use (they are not restricted to non-metal armour). Prioritize Spells like: Guidance for skill checks both in and out of combat. Healing Word is a valuable tool for Druids to revive fallen allies from a distance, without consuming your action. Moonbeam is a potent AOE spell that can be repositioned with your action. Misty Step provides mobility, allowing you to teleport and position yourself effectively. Barbarian's Rage cannot be cast during Wildshape, but may be cast prior to entering for full effect (Though may be disallowed on the same turn due to Circle of the Moon Druid requiring both as bonus actions.)\n\nGuidance for skill checks both in and out of combat.
