Feats are special talents or expertise that provide special capabilities to characters. At certain levels, your character will get to choose between an Ability Score Improvement Feature or a Feat.\n\nActor Information\n\nYour Charisma increases by 1, to a maximum of 20. Your Proficiency Bonus is also doubled for Deception and Performance Checks.\n\nHow to unlock Actor\n\nYou'll need to fulfill the following requirements to unlock Actor\n\nAll Classes at Level 4\n\nActor Tips & Notes\n\nIf you plan on taking this feat, set your Charisma to 17 in whatever class you're playing that's Charisma-based and then move it to 18 with this to increase your ability modifier perfectly. Keep in mind, that the proficiency bonus that's doubled for Deception and Performance checks will apply even if you don't have proficiency in Deception and Performance. So, what this means is you're better off not taking proficiency in these two skills during Character Creation because then you would only gain plus two to them from this feat, whereas you'd gain plus four if you don't have proficiency already. It is possible to gain a Charisma beyond 20 by wearing Birthright, the hat that gives +2 CHA.
