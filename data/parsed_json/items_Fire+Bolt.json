It deals Fire damage and creates a small area of fire terrain.\n\nBG3 Fire Bolt Information\n\nDescription: Hurl a mote of fire. Level: Cantrip School: Evocation Casting Time: Action Range: 18m Requires Concentration: No Saving Throw: None\n\nHow to Acquire Fire Bolt in Baldur's Gate3\n\nFire bolt can be acquired by the following classes and races: Wizard, Sorcerer, Arcane Trickster, Eldritch Knight High Elf, High Half-Elf Fire bolt can be cast by using the following Items: Scroll of Fire Bolt Gold Wyrmling Staff Incandescent Staff\n\nWizard, Sorcerer, Arcane Trickster, Eldritch Knight High Elf, High Half-Elf\n\nScroll of Fire Bolt Gold Wyrmling Staff Incandescent Staff\n\nFire Bolt Tips & Notes in BG3\n\nThe spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10) and 10th level (3d10). Prior to Patch 3 this spell did 1d6 damage and created a fire terrain effect. The fire terrain meant that this spell would usually do 1d6+2d4 damage: 1d6 for the bolt, 1d4 for the terrain, and 1d4 for the burning effect from the terrain. After Patch 3 the spell now functions like D&D 5th Edition in that it deals 1d10 damage but no fire terrain effect. The verbal component has the caster saying \"Ignis\", Latin for \"fire\".\n\nCantrips Acid Splash ♦ Blade Ward ♦ Bone Chill ♦ Dancing Lights ♦ Eldritch Blast ♦ Friends ♦ Githyanki Psionics: Mage Hand ♦ Guidance ♦ Improved Minor Illusion ♦ Light ♦ Mage Hand ♦ Minor Illusion ♦ Poison Spray ♦ Produce Flame ♦ Ray of Frost ♦ Resistance ♦ Sacred Flame ♦ Selûne's Dream ♦ Shillelagh ♦ Shocking Grasp ♦ Thaumaturgy ♦ Thorn Whip ♦ True Strike ♦ Vicious Mockery",
