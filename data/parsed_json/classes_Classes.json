  "content": "Classes in Baldur's Gate 3 (BG) are one of the unique features of characters, as these can determine the abilities, skills, and other factors that affect the player's interaction with the world. Choosing a Class will determine how the world will interact with the character both inside and outside of combat, and dialogue options will be different. There are a total of 12 base Classes in Baldur's Gate 3, which can be freely chosen by the player during character creation.\n\nBG3 Full Game Note: In the full launch of Baldur's Gate 3, Ability Score Points for Races that were present in Early Access are removed. Instead, Ability Score Points in the full game correspond with the Class players will choose. However, you can edit these further if desired. See the Multiclassing page for in-depth information about taking levels in different classes as your character progresses. Players can change their Companions Class as well as their Class by using the Respec option via a specific NPC\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Classes Quick Navigation\n\nClick to jump to a specific section of the page\n\nNEW!

Certain Races may have a better affinity to specific Classes and Subclasses, for example. Additionally, you may want to opt for unique schools of magic based on Role-Play or simple preference. If you're going to optimize your character and party, check out our Builds section.\n\nHow does Class Affect the Game BG3?\n\nEach Class in Baldur's Gate 3 comes with unique interactions because of their special abilities and personalities. An example developers gave of these unique interactions will be the Druid's ability to interact with animals and engage in dialogue which other classes will not be able to experience.\n\nThis means that the game will interact with your character and introduce different features and storylines depending on your choices as early as Character Creation. This could open up new unique quests, dialogues, interactions, combat, animations, and experiences based on your chosen Class as well as your chosen Background and Race.\n\nWhat's the Level Cap in BG3?\n\nLarian has confirmed that characters will be capped at level 12 in the official release, unlocking Planar Allies, Otto's Irresistible Dance, and Chain Lightning.\n\nWhat's new in Baldur's Gate 3 Classes?\n\nUpon the official release of Baldur's Gate 3, players will be able to see all 12 Classes which expands to about 46 Subclasses during Character Creation. On average, one class will have about 3 subclasses, but other specific Classes may have more to try out such as the Cleric and the Wizard. Baldur's Gate 3 also introduces the Multiclassing feature that will be available at release.\n\nParty Composition in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nParty composition is not a hard prerequisite when playing Baldur's Gate 3, although you want to balance it between the roles of the different classes in the game. You do not have to think of what class is right for your character, as your Companions' classes can be respecced — giving you the freedom of choosing your preferred class without thinking of the synergy between you and your companions. Respeccing does not affect your companions' story or lore in any way. For example, Wyll will always be a Warlock story-wise even if you change his class to a Fighter or Druid.\n\nWhat's new in Baldur's Gate 3 Classes?\n\nUpon the official release of Baldur's Gate 3, players will be able to see all 12 Classes which expands to about 46 Subclasses during Character Creation. On average, one class will have about 3 subclasses, but other specific Classes may have more to try out such as the Cleric and the Wizard. Baldur's Gate 3 also introduces the Multiclassing feature that will be available on release.\n\nWhat are Subclasses in BG3\n\nSubclasses are specializations of a class. Players can opt for different branching paths and continue to benefit from the features of the initial class, while also gaining unique abilities for their Subclass. So a Rogue, for example, will have to opt to become a Thief or Arcane Trickster at level 3. From that point onward, the character will receive all the benefits of the Rogue class, plus the special benefits of their Subclass of choice.\n\nKeep in mind that during character creation, not all subclasses are unlocked for players to initially choose, as most of these subclasses require a certain level in order to select the branching path of your class. As for some classes that allow you to choose a subclass during Character Creation, you can always check its description and the initial features that you gain.\n\nRespec a Character in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, you will be able to Respec your characters as many times as you want, as long as you have the required gold and have already added Withers to the Camp. Approach him and select Respec among the services he provides. Withers will ask for 100 gold pieces for his service. The price of the service DOES NOT increase during the course of the game, nor if you use it frequently.\n\nAny character can interact with Withers to Respec, even your Companions, if they pay the asking price. Note that respecing a character does not change its interactions or Quests.\n\nHow to Select Magic for Spellcasting Classes?\n\nWhen choosing a Spellcasting class such as Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard, you are given the option to select your Cantrips and Spells. By default, they have recommended cantrips and spells but you can always change the initial magic that is equipped by your character. For new players, we highly recommend just following the default spells unless you're someone who is familiar with 5e. As you progress, in most cases, you can always change your Spells later on according to your preference.\n\nMulticlassing Guide for Baldur's Gate 3\n\nMulticlassing in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nMulticlassing is a feature that will be implemented upon the full release of Baldur's Gate 3. This is the ability to switch to another Class or Character and can be done in-game. In order to allow all your wildest dream class combinations, Larian removed Ability Score Prerequisites. So there's no more need to get your Charisma up to a pesky 13 if you decide to make a soul pact with a playful Archfey or dangerous Fiend. You can Multiclass into anything your roleplay and build desires demand. In short, this means warriors will be able to wield arcane spells, rogues can master divine magic, spellcasters may dabble in martial prowess, and you’ll have the freedom to build the exact class that you want. While Multiclassing can be powerful, it may also spread your character's ability thin, so it's best that you plan and prepare ahead when you consider multiclassing.\n\nWhy Should I Multiclass in BG3?\n\nWhether you are an experimenter at heart who forges class hybrids through careful consideration or you just can't decide between a warrior and a mage, in Baldur's Gate 3, it's possible to test your wildest builds. Multiclassing really changes the game – literally – because it allows you to fully customize the theme of your character. It has both a roleplay and a practical function, leading to all sorts of chaotic combinations and experimentations.\n\nUnlike standard DND 5e rules, Larian has removed the Ability Score Prerequisites. You can Multiclass into anything your roleplay and build desires demand. In short, this means warriors will be able to wield arcane spells, rogues can master divine magic, spellcasters may dabble in martial prowess, and you’ll have the freedom to build the exact class that you want.\n\nFor each level, you can choose a different class to spend points on and begin building a bespoke Multiclass character. Given the possible combinations, it's recommended experienced D&D players fully leverage this feature. But if you decide to evenly spread all your points into every class for no strategic reason, there's naturally an achievement for that too.\n\nNote: Baldur's Gate 3 has a level cap of 12, Multiclassing means you won't get the full effect and abilities of a specific class.\n\nMulticlassing Level Distribution in BG3\n\nMulticlassing will divide your character's experience between different classes, it's is essential that you focus on some of the key abilities of the class you want to utilize. Be mindful of level distribution and keep in mind that your abilities will be determined by the levels you invest in each class. It's best to consider level distribution to ensure you gain some essential abilities at reasonable intervals.\n\nMulticlass Options in the Story\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, a multiclassing character can choose all his/her class-specific responses. For example, a monk/rogue can choose monk response or rogue response. By Multiclassing, it is easier to test and create the character you dream of without the need of starting a new game and creating a new character. Multiclassing is easily possible as long as you meet the requirements.\n\nHow do I Multiclass in BG3?\n\nAs mentioned, Multiclass becomes available as soon as you acquire a class level. For example, as early as reaching Level 2 Warlock, you will have the option to continue leveling up in your class or to delve into another in the level-up menu. By doing so, keep in mind that as soon as you decide to Multiclass, your Character level will never be the same as your Class level. An example of this is if you are a Level 3 Warlock and decide to Multiclass into a Level 1 Bard, your Character level will be Level 4. The reason why we mention that it is important to consider looking at your character level is that some aspects such as an increase in proficiency bonuses correlate with it. While on the other hand, by reviewing your class levels, you'll be able to determine what class features are unlocked.\n\nWith that being said, we do want to advise you that when Multiclassing there are some limitations to it. First, we want to point out that you are free to Multiclass to any class you want, going back to limitations, an example would be if you start off with a Wizard and multi-class to a Sorcerer, it doesn't mean your spells slots will be doubled or in some cases, actions such as an extra attack will not stack. So make sure that you always consider the different factors when it comes to Multiclassing in Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nExperiment and Discover Unique Character Combinations in BG3\n\nThere are a lot of possibilities for creating unique characters that the Multiclassing feature offers, so don't be afraid to experiment, discover, and try out different combinations when considering multiclassing. Don't forget to have fun and enjoy the process of discovering new playstyles and character concepts that would make your character unique in its own way.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Best Classes for Beginners\n\nFor beginners diving into the world of Baldur's Gate 3, some classes offer a smoother learning curve and versatile gameplay. Here are a few classes that are often considered among the best for beginners:\n\nFighter: The Fighter class is straightforward and well-suited for newcomers. They excel in combat, have a high hit point pool, and can wear heavy armor. Fighters can focus on melee or ranged combat, offering flexibility in playstyle. Rogue: Rogues are agile and excel in stealth and ranged attacks. Their abilities make them excellent for both sneaky approaches and dealing substantial damage from a distance. They can also disarm traps, which can be particularly useful for beginners navigating the game's challenges. Cleric: Clerics are versatile spellcasters who can heal, buff allies, and deal damage to enemies. They wear medium armor and can use a variety of weapons, making them adaptable in various situations. Warlock: Warlocks have a unique spellcasting mechanic and access to powerful spells. Their spell slots recharge on short rests, which can be more forgiving for beginners who may not be familiar with the longer rest mechanics of other spellcasting classes. Wizard: While spellcasting can be complex, the Wizard class provides a wide range of magical options. Their spellbook system allows for spell customization, and they can specialize in different schools of magic to suit different playstyles. Ranger: Rangers are skilled in both ranged and melee combat, and they have a connection to nature that offers unique abilities. They can summon animals to aid them in battle, which can be helpful for beginners seeking additional support.\n\nFighter: The Fighter class is straightforward and well-suited for newcomers.

They can summon animals to aid them in battle, which can be helpful for beginners seeking additional support.\n\nQuick Tips for Begginers\n\nThese tips should help players get started with their chosen class in Baldur's Gate 3 and maximize their effectiveness in and out of combat.\n\nUnarmored Defense: Invest in Strength and Constitution for increased armor class if you plan to go unarmored. Use Rage Liberally: You typically long rest after every one or two combat encounters, so don't hesitate to use your rage often. Choose Subclass: For beginners, consider the straightforward Berserker subclass or the more dynamic Wildheart. Two-Handed Weapons: Consider using a two-handed weapon for maximum damage output. Great Weapon Master Feat: At level 4, consider taking this feat for extra damage and a bonus action if you kill an enemy or critically hit. Extra Attack at Level 5: Barbarians gain an extra attack at level 5, making them more formidable.\n\nVicious Mockery: Use this unique cantrip to deal damage and give enemies disadvantage on their next attack roll. Healing Word: Prepare this spell for its versatility, as it's a bonus action, can be used at range, and can revive fallen allies. Choose Subclass Based on Party Needs: College of Lore for spellcasting, College of Valour or College of Swords for martial capabilities. Delay Multiclassing: For new players, it's recommended not to multiclass until after reaching level 6.\n\nLife Domain or Light Domain for New Players: Life Domain boosts healing and provides heavy armor proficiency, while Light Domain focuses on offensive spellcasting. Tempest or War for Martial Focus: Consider these domains if you want a more martial-focused cleric. Bonus Attack with War Domain: War Domain allows you to make an extra attack using your bonus action a certain number of times based on your Wisdom modifier. Essential Spells: Healing Word, Guidance, and Enhance Ability are crucial spells for a cleric. Guiding Bolt: Use this spell for high damage output, especially in early game encounters.\n\nHealing Word is a valuable spell for Druids; consider picking it. Speak with Animals is a useful role-playing spell to have. Goodberry provides effective healing. Guidance is handy for skill checks and saves. Choose your Druid Circle based on your desired playstyle.\n\nUnderstand Your Role: Fighters are typically frontline combatants, serving as the party's tank and damage dealer. Choose Your Fighting Style: At level 1, Fighters select a fighting style. Options like Archery, Great Weapon Fighting, or Defense can greatly influence your combat effectiveness. Choose one that fits your preferred playstyle. Know Your Subclass: Fighters have several subclasses, each with unique abilities. Understand your subclass's strengths and how to use its features effectively. For example, a Battle Master uses superiority dice for special combat maneuvers.. Ranged Fighters: If you're an archer or ranged Fighter, consider your positioning carefully. Stay at a distance to avoid unnecessary damage, but make sure you have a clear line of sight to your targets.\n\nFocus on Dexterity and Wisdom: Dexterity is crucial for your Armor Class and attack rolls, while Wisdom affects your Monk abilities and spellcasting (if you choose a subclass that offers Spells). Use Unarmored Defense: Monks don't need armor. Their Unarmored Defense feature allows them to calculate their AC using Dexterity and Wisdom, making them hard to hit. Multiclassing: Be cautious when multiclassing with a Monk, as it may slow your progress in gaining higher-level Monk abilities. Generally, it's best to stick with Monk levels for character progression.\n\nChoose between sword and shield or two-handed weapons based on your preferred role. Divine Smite is your main source of damage; use it strategically. Select an oath that aligns with your character's beliefs. Use Lay on Hands for healing and removing ailments. Delay multiclassing until you've gained the benefits of extra attack at level 5\n\nDecide on your preferred fighting style, such as archery or two-weapon fighting. Utilize favored enemy bonuses based on your chosen type. Take advantage of your Natural Explorer abilities, especially in exploration. Consider Beast Master or Gloom Stalker subclasses. Multiclassing can be done at any point, but waiting until level 5 for extra attack is often wise.\n\nUse Sneak Attack by gaining advantage or attacking alongside an ally. Take advantage of the Cunning Action feature to Hide or in combat. Choose between the different Rogue subclasses based on your preferred style, but Assassin is begginer-friendly. Hex is a great spell for extra damage. Don't rush into multiclassing; Rogue's damage primarily comes from Sneak Attack.\n\nSorcery Points can be used to create extra spell slots. Hex is a great spell for added damage. Consider the Draconic Bloodline for damage and defense bonuses. Choose Metamagic options that suit your Spells. Multiclassing can be done at any point, but think about what it adds to your character's abilities.\n\nEldritch Blast is a potent cantrip; consider it your go-to attack. Agonizing Blast and Repelling Blast are valuable Eldritch Invocations. The Fiend is a begginer-friendly choice with offensive spells. Hex is a strong spell for extra damage. Carefully consider Pact Boon and multiclassing; prioritize Spells and Features that fit your character concept.\n\nExperiment with a variety of Spells to fit different situations. Evocation or Divination schools are solid choices. Don't hesitate to pick spells like Magic Missile and Grease. Consider a race or multiclass for added armor proficiency. Wizard subclass features can significantly impact your playstyle.",
