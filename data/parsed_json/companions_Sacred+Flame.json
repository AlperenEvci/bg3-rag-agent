Sacred Flame is a Cantrip from the Evocation School. Spells can be used for dealing damage to Enemies, inflict Status Ailments, buff Characters or interact with the environment.\n\nSacred Flame Information\n\nDescription: Engulf a target in a flame-like radiance. Level: Cantrip School: Evocation Casting Time: Action Range:18m/60ft Requires Concentration: No Saving Throw: Dexterity\n\nHow to Acquire Sacred Flame\n\nSacred Flame can be acquired by the following classes: Cleric\n\nSacred Flame Tips & Notes\n\nThe spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8) and 10th level (3d8). Unlike many ranged damage spells, Sacred Flame doesn't travel directly between the caster and target, so it can't be blocked by objects and ignores cover. Because Sacred Flame uses a saving throw and not an attack roll, it gains no benefit from high ground and no penalty from low ground. The target can still be \"too high,\" however. The verbal component has the caster saying \"Incendo\", Latin for \"I set on fire\". Differences from 5th Edition D&D: 3rd damage increase come at level 10 instead of 11.\n\nCantrips Acid Splash ♦ Blade Ward ♦ Bone Chill ♦ Dancing Lights ♦ Eldritch Blast ♦ Fire Bolt ♦ Friends ♦ Githyanki Psionics: Mage Hand ♦ Guidance ♦ Improved Minor Illusion ♦ Light ♦ Mage Hand ♦ Minor Illusion ♦ Poison Spray ♦ Produce Flame ♦ Ray of Frost ♦ Resistance ♦ Selûne's Dream ♦ Shillelagh ♦ Shocking Grasp ♦ Thaumaturgy ♦ Thorn Whip ♦ True Strike ♦ Vicious Mockery",
