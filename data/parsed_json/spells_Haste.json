Haste is a Lvl 3 Spell from the Transmutation school. Spells can be used for dealing damage to Enemies, inflict Status Ailments, buff Characters or interact with the environment.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Haste Information\n\nDescription: Target yourself or an ally to become Hastened: Gain an action, become faster and harder to hit. When the condition ends, becomes Lethargic. Effect: The target gains +2 AC, Advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws, double Movement Speed, and one extra Action per turn. Target becomes Lethargic and unable to Move or take Actions for 1 turn when the spell ends. Level: Lvl 3 spell School: Transmutation School Casting Time:Action Range: 9m Duration: 10 turns Requires Concentration: Yes Saving Throw: None\n\nHow to Acquire Haste in BG3\n\nHaste can be acquired by the following classes: Sorcerer, Wizard, Oath of Vengeance Warlock (Pact of the Tome) at Level 5 Druid (Circle of the Land with the Grassland or Arctic Spell Circle) at Level 5 Bard (Magical Secrets) at Level 6 (Lore) or 10 Haste can be cast by using the following Items: Potion of Speed (3 turns) Darkfire Shortbow allows wearer to cast the spell Gontr Mael allows wearer to Haste himself (5 turns)\n\nSorcerer, Wizard, Oath of Vengeance Warlock (Pact of the Tome) at Level 5 Druid (Circle of the Land with the Grassland or Arctic Spell Circle) at Level 5 Bard (Magical Secrets) at Level 6 (Lore) or 10\n\nPotion of Speed (3 turns) Darkfire Shortbow allows wearer to cast the spell Gontr Mael allows wearer to Haste himself (5 turns)\n\nHaste Tips & Notes for BG3\n\nIn BG3, Haste allows the target to cast two spells or double their number of Attacks (including Extra Attacks) per turn. Haste is a very strong option for Sorcerers using Metamagic: Twinned Spell to hasten two targets. In build 4.1.1.3648072, the 'Hastened' condition granted by the Haste spell has a special interaction with Potions of Speed, which also grants the status (though only for 3 turns as opposed to the spell's 10 turns). If you cast Haste on a unit who already has the hastened condition, the new version will be overwritten by the spell, leaving you with 10 rounds remaining of Hastened. However, you will also be given one round of \"Lethargic\". Therefore, if you cast Haste on a hastened unit after they have used all of their actions and movement for their turn, they will start their next turn with 9 turns of hastened remaining and no debuff from the previous haste effect. Combining the new cast of Haste with something like Sanctuary will allow you to largely bypass the downsides of Haste.\n\nLvl 3 Spells Animate Dead ♦ Beacon of Hope ♦ Bestow curse ♦ Blinding Smite ♦ Blink ♦ Call Lightning ♦ Celestial Haste ♦ Conjure Barrage ♦ Counterspell ♦ Crusader's Mantle ♦ Daylight ♦ Elemental Weapon ♦ Fear ♦ Feign Death ♦ Fireball ♦ Fly ♦ Gaseous Form ♦ Glyph of Warding ♦ Grant Flight ♦ Hunger of Hadar ♦ Hypnotic Pattern ♦ Lightning Arrow ♦ Lightning Bolt ♦ Mass Healing Word ♦ Paralyzing Ray ♦ Plant Growth ♦ Protection from Energy ♦ Remove Curse ♦ Revivify ♦ Scorching Ray Shot ♦ Sleet Storm ♦ Slow ♦ Speak with Dead ♦ Spirit Guardians ♦ Stinking Cloud ♦ Summon Quothe the Raven ♦ Vampiric Touch",
