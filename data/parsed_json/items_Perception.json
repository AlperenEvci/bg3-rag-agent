It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\n\nHow to Increase Perception\n\nThe following classes can choose Perception as a proficiency: Barbarian, Bard (can also choose as Expertise), Druid, Fighter, Ranger, Rogue (can also choose as Expertise) The following feats provide bonuses to Perception: Dungeon Delver (supposed to provide Advantage, but it's broken as of Patch 5) The following items and spells provide bonuses to Perception Checks: Shapeshifter's Boon Ring (+1d4 to all Ability Checks while Disguise Self is active) Mask of Soul Perception (+2 to Perception Checks) Watcher's Shield / Justiciar's Greatshield / Hellrider Longbow / Ambusher (Advantage on Perception checks) Guidance (+1d4 to all Ability Checks.
