In Wild Shape, this feat works for attack rolls but not damage. The extra damage will bypass damage reductions from Sturdy objects. For thrown weapon attacks, rather than providing a damage bonus (like it does for unarmed attacks), Tavern Brawler triggers an additional instance of damage in the combat log equal to your Strength bonus. And because it's treated as a separate \"attack\" from the original throw, it triggers the bonuses from Ring of Flinging and Gloves of Uninhibited Kushigo again, thus doubling both items' effects. It also triggers an additional 1 Lightning damage from Lightning Charges. This feat applies to unarmed attacks including Flurry of Blows, Bonus Action Unarmed Strike, and Ki Resonation: Punch. To get one of the strongest and most accessible combat classes at Level 4, consider getting a Berserker Barbarian with Tavern Brawler, and add Throw Weapons to allow 18 STR High hit rates and High Damage, or you can also try experimenting with a Barbarian Sniper with Throw Weapons and Eagle Heart, you can stay perched on top of enemies and do Throw Attacks or Diving Strikes. If you want to trivialize the game, consider doing a DEX Monk with Tavern Brawler and Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. This gives you all the advantages of a DEX Monk while using STR as a dump stat without any downsides. For Monks, if your STR is higher than your DEX, your bonuses will be STR + STR, but if your DEX is higher, the bonuses will be STR + DEX.\n\nAll Feats in Baldur's Gate 3 Ability Improvements ♦ Actor ♦ Alert ♦ Athlete ♦ Charger ♦ Crossbow Expert ♦ Defensive Duellist ♦ Dual Wielder ♦ Dungeon Delver ♦ Durable ♦ Elemental Adept ♦ Great Weapon Master ♦ Heavily Armoured ♦ Heavy Armour Master ♦ Lightly Armoured ♦ Lucky (Feat) ♦ Mage Slayer ♦ Magic Initiate: Bard ♦ Magic Initiate: Cleric ♦ Magic Initiate: Druid ♦ Magic Initiate: Sorcerer ♦ Magic Initiate: Warlock ♦ Magic Initiate: Wizard ♦ Martial Adept ♦ Medium Armour Master ♦ Mobile ♦ Moderately Armoured ♦ Observant ♦ Performer ♦ Polearm Master ♦ Resilient ♦ Ritual Caster ♦ Savage Attacker ♦ Sentinel ♦ Sharpshooter ♦ Shield Master ♦ Skilled ♦ Spell Sniper ♦ Tough ♦ Unstable Blood ♦ War Caster ♦ Weapon Master",
