  "content": "Kill Kagha Type Quest Act Act 1 Location Druid Grove Reward __reward__\n\nKill Kagha is a Quest in Baldur's Gate 3. Kill Kagha can be acquired during Act 1. Kill Kagha is a quest done as a subquest for the Save the Refugees Main Quest Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earn more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nKill Kagha Objectives\n\nThe tieflings and druids are at an impasse. Killing Kagha might tip the balance.\n\n◆ Fight the druids.\n\nWe attacked Kagha, and the druids turned on all of the tieflings.\n\n◆ Return to Zevlor.\n\nKagha and the other druids are dead. The conflict in the grove has ended. We should check on the tieflings.\n\nZevlor thanked us for taking care of Kagha. Now we can focus on the goblin threat.\n\nKill Kagha Walkthrough\n\nThis quest unlocks a dialogue option with Kagha saying Zevlor wants her gone, and that you are here to get rid of her. This immediately initiates combat, and triggers the war between the Druids and the Tieflings.\n\nHow to unlock Kill Kagha\n\nKill Kagha Rewards\n\nThis subquest hast no direct rewards. Indirect Rewards (drops, related quest rewards, etc.) Hellrider's Pride (reward from Zevlor dialogue; obtained via any method that stops Kagha's ritual, killing Kagha is not required) Broodmother's Revenge (dropped by Kagha) Key of the Ancients (dropped by Findal if he was rescued and turned hostile when attacking Kagha without using Investigate Kagha dialogue options, or if he is killed by Kagha or her allies) Rune of the Wolf (dropped by Rath if he dies in the conflict, or if he is killed by Kagha or her allies; leads to the Hidden Vault containing Sorrow, the Robe of Summer, and other loot) Merchant loot (if merchants like Arron and Dammon die in the conflict) If all of the Druid NPCs die, many objects and containers are now no longer considered \"stealing\". This includes the Idol of Silvanus, allowing for easy completion of Steal the Sacred Idol if the quest was obtained beforehand, rewarding Ring of Protection. Various keys (Kagha's Key; if the Druids turn against the Tieflings and begin killing each other, multiple Storage Keys and the Prison Key may be found on select Tiefling corpses should they die in the conflict, such as Zorru, Guex, and Ikaron)\n\nHellrider's Pride (reward from Zevlor dialogue; obtained via any method that stops Kagha's ritual, killing Kagha is not required) Broodmother's Revenge (dropped by Kagha) Key of the Ancients (dropped by Findal if he was rescued and turned hostile when attacking Kagha without using Investigate Kagha dialogue options, or if he is killed by Kagha or her allies) Rune of the Wolf (dropped by Rath if he dies in the conflict, or if he is killed by Kagha or her allies; leads to the Hidden Vault containing Sorrow, the Robe of Summer, and other loot) Merchant loot (if merchants like Arron and Dammon die in the conflict) If all of the Druid NPCs die, many objects and containers are now no longer considered \"stealing\".

They will begin killing each other in real time across all of the Druid Grove while you are locked in turn-based combat with Kagha unless the party splits up. This can potentially result in various quest failures depending on which NPCs die (such as Dammon who is tied to Karlach's Companion Quest \"The Hellion's Heart\"), as well as losing access to multiple merchants. TO AVOID WAR BUT STILL KILL KAGHA: Combat can be initiated through dialogue options granted by the subquest Investigate Kagha, which will have most of the Druids turn against Kagha and the Shadow Druids and aid you in combat. The Druids will not turn against the Tieflings, saving all NPCs outside the Emerald Grove chamber from potentially dying.\n\nThe Druids will not turn against the Tieflings, saving all NPCs outside the Emerald Grove chamber from potentially dying.\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
