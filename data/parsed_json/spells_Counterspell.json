Counterspell is a Lvl 3 Spell from the Abjuration school.

The spell must be 3rd level or lower. If it is higher, you must succeed a Check to nullify it, the difficulty of which is based on the spell's Level. Level: Lvl 3 spell School: Abjuration School Casting Time: - Range: 18m Requires Concentration: No Saving Throw: N/A\n\nHow to Acquire Counterspell\n\nCounterspell can be acquired by the following classes:\n\nSorcerer Warlock Wizard Bard (Magical Secrets) at Level 6 (Lore) or 10\n\nCounterspell can be cast by using the following Items:\n\nStaff of Interruption\n\nCounterspell Tips & Notes\n\nVery essential in any party, the ability to completely nullify a spell that is about to be casted can be the difference between your party being alive or dead. Counterspell also mentions that it can only nullify it as long as the spell is equal or less than level 3, but if the spell that is being casted level 4, then Counterspell is required to be level 4 to counter it.\n\nWhen a reaction is given, you can see what level is the spell by hovering on it and also the damage, one trick to realize the exact spell level is to read the damage that is about to deal, important that in reactions you will get an entire details of who's casting the spell, on who they are casting and what spell they are casting, if you hover on the spell you will see its spell level and the damage it will deal, the damage dealt will change if it was upcasted but the \"level\" part of it will not change, examples:\n\nFireball, Level 3 - 8d6 damage requires Counterspell Level 3. Fireball, Level 3 - 10d6 damage requires Counterspell Level 5. Polymorph, Level 4 requires Counterspell Level 4. (Note: There's no way to know if this was upscaled)\n\nUpscaled none-damaging spells are very rare and sometimes scripted for certain special battles, in some cases it is impossible to figure out the exact spell level and there's some fights where they will cast an upscaled Level 1 none-damaging spell that cannot be countered by level 3, there's no possible way to counter a level 7 - 9 spell (level 7, 8 and 9 spell slots unlocks when you reach level 13, 15 and 17 respectively but the game caps to level 12).\n\nSince it is a reaction that is beneficial, it is wise to set your \"Attack of Opportunity\" to \"ask\" so you don't lose your reaction to counter a dangerous spell.\n\nLvl 3 Spells Animate Dead ♦ Beacon of Hope ♦ Bestow curse ♦ Blinding Smite ♦ Blink ♦ Call Lightning ♦ Celestial Haste ♦ Conjure Barrage ♦ Crusader's Mantle ♦ Daylight ♦ Elemental Weapon ♦ Fear ♦ Feign Death ♦ Fireball ♦ Fly ♦ Gaseous Form ♦ Glyph of Warding ♦ Grant Flight ♦ Haste ♦ Hunger of Hadar ♦ Hypnotic Pattern ♦ Lightning Arrow ♦ Lightning Bolt ♦ Mass Healing Word ♦ Paralyzing Ray ♦ Plant Growth ♦ Protection from Energy ♦ Remove Curse ♦ Revivify ♦ Scorching Ray Shot ♦ Sleet Storm ♦ Slow ♦ Speak with Dead ♦ Spirit Guardians ♦ Stinking Cloud ♦ Summon Quothe the Raven ♦ Vampiric Touch",
