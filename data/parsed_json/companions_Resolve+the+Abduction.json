Resolve the Abduction can be acquired during Act II and has the player clear the Last Light Inn of Enemies after First Marcus abducts Isobel. Resolve the Abduction is a branching subquest for the main questline Infiltrate Moonrise Towers. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3 and earn more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nResolve the Abduction Objectives\n\nGo to Last Light Inn.\n\nZ'rell ordered us to kidnap Isobel, a cleric hiding out at Last Light Inn. An agent of the Absolute is there, keeping close watch on her.\n\nHelp Marcus capture Isobel.\n\nMarcus, a True Soul who has infiltrated Last Light, told us that his powerful master demands that the cleric Isobel be taken to Moonrise Towers alive. If we do this, Last Light will no longer be protected from the shadow curse. A winged Flaming Fist who serves the Absolute swooped in to try and abduct Isobel. We decided to side with him. Z'rell asked us to return to Last Light and help Marcus kidnap Isobel. If we do this, we will gain an audience with Ketheric.\n\nProtect Isobel from Marcus.\n\nA winged Flaming Fist who serves the Absolute swooped in to try and abduct Isobel. We decided to help Isobel fight him off. We refused to help Marcus abduct Isobel, and instead helped her fight him off. We attacked Marcus after he told us about his plan to abduct Isobel. We warned Jaheira about Marcus' plan to abduct Isobel. We should help her terminate Marcus before he can carry out his plan.\n\nReport to Z'rell.\n\nWe helped Marcus abduct Isobel, and she was carried off to Moonrise Towers. Z'rell will be pleased.\n\nReport to Ketheric.\n\nWe helped Marcus abduct Isobel, and she was carried off to Moonrise Towers. This should earn us an audience with Ketheric.\n\nQuest Complete Descriptions\n\nWe prevented Marcus from abducting Isobel. Why would the cult want her alive? We weren't able to save Isobel from Marcus, the True Soul who infiltrated Last Light. When she was captured, the shield protecting Last Light collapsed. We helped Marcus abduct Isobel and carry her off to Moonrise Towers. When we killed Nightsong, Last Light fell to the shadow curse. Isobel died in the subsequent battle. We angered the denizens of Moonrise Towers; it seems unlikely that anyone there will still want to reward us for abducting Isobel. We freed Nightsong, and Moonrise Towers is now under attack. It is unlikely we will be welcomed there. We reported back on Isobel's kidnapping to Ketheric himself. We reported back on Isobel's kidnapping. Z'rell has granted us an audience with Ketheric.\n\nResolve the Abduction Walkthrough\n\nHow to unlock Resolve the Abduction\n\nLocation: Last Light Inn Resolve the Abduction is a subquest for the primary Main Quest: Infiltrate Moonrise Towers\n\nResolve the Abduction Rewards\n\nResolve the Abduction Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
