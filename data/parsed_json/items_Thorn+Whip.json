Thorn Whip is a Cantrip from the Transmutation school. Spells are regulated forms of magic energy that can be used for dealing damage to Enemies, inflicting Status Effects, buffing Characters, or interacting with the environment. While casting usually Spells uses up Spell Slots, the number of which a character has is increased as the character increases in spellcaster Classes' levels, Cantrips are Spells that can be cast without using up Spell Slots. To balance this out, Cantrips usually are weaker Spells, that are mainly used as utility both inside and outside of battle. That being said, Cantrips can prove to be powerful depending on how a character uses them.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Thorn Whip Information\n\nDescription: Pulls the creature 3m closer to you.
