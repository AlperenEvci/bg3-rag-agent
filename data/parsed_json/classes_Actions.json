  "content": "Actions in Baldur's Gate 3 are certain moves your character can perform. Actions can be used in both exploration and combat to maneuver across the battlefield or to harm or aid Characters. The actions that a Character can perform are based on their Class and Equipment. Below you can find a list of all Actions in Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nThere are special types of Actions called Bonus Actions which can be performed on top of your normal Actions.\n\nAction Resources\n\nTo perform Actions in Baldur's Gate 3, your character needs to spend the corresponding resources. All characters can perform at least one Action and a Bonus action per turn. Note that certain abilities, such as Action Surge, may grant you an extra action point.\n\nAction is the primary resource players spend in order to attack or cast Spells. Certain Skills have specific action types assigned to them. Most of these resources replenish once the turn is over.\n\nThis is important information to be fully aware of during combat because It will help you plan your turns accordingly. Note that you don't necessarily have to spend both actions to end your turn.\n\nFor example: While playing as a Warlock, you move to a vantage point and cast Eldritch Blast on an Enemy. Doing so will spend your Action for this turn. Blocking you from performing another action until your next turn. Your Bonus Action still remains usable. Using a Potion of Healing or using Jump to change your position, spends the remaining Bonus Action resource. These two are just an example of two possible Bonus Actions, and not the only choices available for players.\n\nTo perform Weapon Actions in Baldur's Gate 3, your character NEEDS to be proficient with that type of weapon. Otherwise, it won't be possible to perform said Weapon action.\n\nAdded on Patch 9, Reactions allow players to respond to certain events or triggers, even when it is not their own turn. This is the Reaction resource icon , and most reactions require this resource in order to be executed, but can also require another one, such as a Spell Slot.\n\nPlayers can perform one reaction with a character per turn.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Combat Guide\n\nAll Actions in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Actions Comparison Table\n\nYou can search by Name, Type, Description, Range, or Requirements.
