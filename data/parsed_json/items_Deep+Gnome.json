Deep Gnome features great vision at night and also possesses the Stone Camouflage. While creating your Character in Baldur's Gate 3, you can choose between 11 different types of Races. Each of them has their special characteristics and some of them have Sub-Races which provide different Features and Traits.\n\nBG3 Full Game Note: In the full launch of Baldur's Gate 3, Ability Score Points for Races that were present in Early Access are removed. And instead, Ability Score Points in the full game correspond with the Class players will choose.\n\nMore guarded than their surface cousins, deep gnomes survive in the Underdark with darkvision and skillful stealth.\n\nDeep Gnome Traits:\n\nSuperior Darkvision: This creature can see in the dark within 24m. Stone Camouflage: You have advantage on Stealth checks.\n\nBase Racial Speed Gnome Cunning: You have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma Saving Throws.\n\nDeep Gnome Tips & Notes\n\nDuring Early Access, the Gnome race used to feature +2 Intelligence and +1 Dexterity. This has been changed in the full launch of BG3 and the Ability Score points are now associated with the Class that players will choose. ?? ??\n\nRaces and Subraces Asmodeus Tiefling ♦ Black Dragonborn ♦ Blue Dragonborn ♦ Brass Dragonborn ♦ Bronze Dragonborn ♦ Copper Dragonborn ♦ Drow ♦ Drow Half-Elf ♦ Duergar ♦ Dwarf ♦ Elf ♦ Forest Gnome ♦ Githyanki ♦ Gnome ♦ Gold Dragonborn ♦ Gold Dwarf ♦ Green Dragonborn ♦ Half-Drow ♦ Half-Elf ♦ Halfling ♦ High Elf ♦ High Half-Elf ♦ Human ♦ Lightfoot Halfling ♦ Lolth-Sworn Drow ♦ Mephistopheles Tiefling ♦ Red Dragonborn ♦ Rock Gnome ♦ Seldarine Drow ♦ Shield Dwarf ♦ Silver Dragonborn ♦ Strongheart Halfling ♦ Tiefling ♦ White Dragonborn ♦ Wood Elf ♦ Wood Half-Elf ♦ Zariel Tiefling",
