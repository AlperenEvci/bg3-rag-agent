Rescue Orin's Victim can be acquired during Act 3 and it is a branching subquest for the main questline Get Orin's Netherstone. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3 and earn more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nRescue Orin's Victim Objectives\n\nSave Orin's victim.\n\nOrin abducted Lae'zel. She told us that she'll release her if we kill Gortash. Orin abducted Lae'zel. She told us that she'll release her if we kill Gortash. Orin abducted Gale. She told us that she'll release him if we kill Gortash. Orin abducted Minthara. She told us that she'll release her if we kill Gortash. Orin abducted Yenna. She told us that she'll release her if we kill Gortash.\n\nFind where Orin is keeping her victim.\n\nWe refused Orin's deal to kill Gortash. There must be another way to save her victim - assuming they're still alive. We should find out where she took them.\n\nDestroy the Steel Watchers.\n\nWe defeated a Steel Watcher - Gortash now has one fewer mechanical lackeys protecting him. Investigating the Steel Watch may be a good approach.\n\nTake down the Steel Watch.\n\nWe found a letter from Orin explaining that striking down Gortash will be difficult with the Steel Watch protecting him. We should find the Steel Watch Foundry and take it down. Hopefully the abductee is still safe.\n\nFind Orin's next instructions.\n\nWe destroyed the Steel Watch Foundry as Orin instructed. She seems to enjoy infiltrating our camp and leaving messages for us there - maybe that's where we'll find further instructions.\n\nWith the Steel Watch destroyed and Gortash vulnerable, Orin left us a message with a clear directive: kill Gortash.\n\nFind Orin's final instructions.\n\nGortash is dead. Orin will surely have left another note for us at camp after learning this.\n\nSubmit to the Bhaalist Murder Tribunal.\n\nOrin left us a note congratulating us for killing Gortash. Her abductee is thankfully still alive. Before we can seek Orin in the Temple of Bhaal and rescue the victim, she demands that we submit to trial in something called the Murder Tribunal.\n\nFind Orin's victim in the Temple of Bhaal.\n\nWe were anointed Unholy Assassin at the Murder Tribunal, gaining access to the Temple of Bhaal. We need to find Orin there if we are to rescue her victim in time. We now know how to gain access to the Temple of Bhaal, but Orin won't be happy that we dismantled the Murder Tribunal. We must reach the Temple and rescue her victim before she learns this. We found Orin's victim tied to an altar. We should be careful as we approach.\n\nCheck up on the victim.\n\nWith Orin defeated, we can finally see if her victim is all right.\n\nQuest Complete Descriptions\n\nWe failed to save Orin's victim from her clutches. Orin's victim is safe and sound back at camp.\n\nRescue Orin's Victim Walkthrough\n\nDuring Act 3, Orin will kidnap one of your companions (or Yenna) under various circumstances. The easiest trigger be exploring the city sewers. The following companions may be kidnaped by Orin: Lae'zel Gale Halsin Minthara Yenna Orin's kdinap can be triggered during long rest, If Lae'zel is targeted, \"she\" claims Yenna is the shapeshifer and threats to kill her, before reveal herself to be Orin. If Gale is targeted, Orin transformed into him and threats to explode the orb and wipe out Baldur's Gate for the good of all. If Yenna is personated by Orin, she will kill Grub and cooked into the skewers. Orin's kidnap can also be triggeres during exploring the City Sewers, she can only kidnap someone who is not currently in your team. If you do not want to trigger the kidnap, avoid getting close to Undercity Ruins waypoint and the exit leads to Guildhall. Orin demands you kill Gortash (Get Gortash's Netherstone), if you don't want to face Gortash first, you can enter Murder Tribunal (Under Candulhallow's Tombstones, you can learn the clues from Investigate the Murders) and get the Amulet of Bhaal. In order to enter the Murder Tribunal, remove the Painting \"Buttefly on Skull\" in Candulhallow's Tombstones, then press the button. You need to hand in bag of hands from Dolor (Investigate the Murders) or the hand of Gortash to gain entry to Murder Tribunal. Or you can fight That Which Guards. In the Murder Tribunal, you will face Sarevok Anchev (Final Boss of BG1 and a Child of Bhaal), Echo of Sendai (Drow Bhaalspawn, boss of BG2:TOB ), Echo of Illasera (Bhaalspawn, boss of BG2:TOB) and the Echo of Amelyssan (final boss of BG2:TOB). Either prove to them you are a holy assassin of Bhaal by killing hollyphant investigator, Valeria. (And Minsc and Jaheira if they are with you.) Or defeat Sarevok (Lv 16 fighter).\n\nLae'zel Gale Halsin Minthara Yenna\n\nWith Amulet of Bhaal, open the gate to Bhaal's Temple (east to Undercity Ruins). You must defeat mutiple Bhaalist before reaching the temple proper. Orin await you in the Centre of Bhaal's Temple, but before confronting her, you can sneak into her chamber and find the corpse of Orin's mother. Use Speak with Dead to Orin's mother can unlock more dialogue option with Orin and save the kidnap victim without intimidation or persuasion checks. Orin threats to kill her victim, either tell her \"Like the salvation your mother offered?\" or pass the intimidation (DC 25) or persuasion (DC 25) checks to save the victim. Orin will transform into Slayer form during the fight, defeat her to get her Netherstone, Bloodthirst and Crimson Mischief.\n\nHow to unlock Rescue Orin's Victim\n\nRescue Orin's Victim Rewards\n\nRescue Orin's Victim Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
