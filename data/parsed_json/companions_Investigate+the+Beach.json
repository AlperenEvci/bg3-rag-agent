Investigate the Beach can be acquired during the chapter 1. Completing Investigate the Beach will progress the story forward.\n\nInvestigate the Beach Objectives\n\nInvestigate the music. Help the Entranced Child . Speak with the Entranced Child. Find Doni.\n\nInvestigate the Beach Walkthrough\n\nThe Seclude Clove of the beach can be located near the Sacred Pool in the Emerald Grove (X:316 Y:553) When you approach the beach, you'll find an Entranced Child (a Tiefling boy) lured by the song of Harpy. Listen to the song and prepare to break away from it by choosing from a set of dialogues. If you succeed, you'll be able to break loose and help the child Tiefling snap out of the alluring song. During one of our playthroughs, we found that the Bard had a high chance to break through the trance. You'll have the option to sing along with the tune which breaks you from the trance, and eventually, the child. If you succeed, the child will eventually disengage and run far from the scene of the fight. If you see a harpy start to sing, divert your attention to the singing harpy to break its concentration. Defeat the harpies, and talk to the boy, he'll give you the password you need to say to Doni so you can enter the Tiefling's Hideout.\n\nBefore going back to Doni, make sure you check behind the rock formation to find a chest you can loot. Retrace your steps and speak to Doni. The muttering Tiefling can be located back at The Hollow, near the entrance of the Sacred Pool (X:227 Y550)\n\nMake sure to \"Not look behind\" and talk to him until you tell him the Password. And make sure you choose \"Leave\" after. The hatch to Tiefling Hideout is right behind Doni. Head inside and speak to Mol, after the good dead of saving the child, she should have the option of mentioning about a quest of stealing the sacred idol (Steal the Sacred Idol). The choice is yours if you would like to accept it or not.\n\nHow to unlock Investigate the Beach\n\nEntranced Child at the beach, Secluded Cove.\n\nInvestigate the Beach Rewards\n\nA story about your bravery written by tiefling kid.\n\nInvestigate the Beach Notes & Tips\n\nWatch out, your vampire get damaged in the water, better to leave him at the camp, or on the cliffs Take positions on the cliffside roads, and get the advantage of high ground, only send one party member to the child Silence spell, speed potion can make a difference, take the harpies one-by-one\n\nQuests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
