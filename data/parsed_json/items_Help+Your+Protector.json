Help Your Protector can be acquired during Act 3. This quest is part of the Personal Quests that you can get in the game. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earn more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Help Your Protector Objectives\n\nHead through the portal to the Dream Visitor's aid.\n\nDuring the night, we were awoken by the voice of the Absolute. A githyanki contingent ambushed us. We heard the voice of the Dream Visitor, desperately seeking our help.\n\nGo to the Dream Visitor's aid.\n\nInside the Astral Prism, we came upon a battle between githyanki and intellect devourers. The Dream Visitor urged us towards the epicentre of the fight - the skull.\n\nDefeat the gish'ra and defend the rogue illithid.\n\nThe imprisoned githyanki is close to breaking free with the help of its allies. The mind flayer is struggling to keep him subdued. Without out help, it will no succeed. We must destroy the githyanki assailants.\n\nQuest Completed!\n\nThe mind flayer revealed itself as none other than our Dream Visitor. It is a rogue illithid, and just like us, it wishes to be free of the elder brain's domination. By helping it to subdue the githyanki prince Orpheus, we remain protected from the Absolute's power.\n\nHow to unlock Help Your Protector\n\nProgress to the Wyrm's Landing in Act 3.\n\nHelp Your Protector Rewards\n\nAstral-Touched Tadpole\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Help Your Protector Walkthrough\n\nAfter beginning Act 3, you'll find yourself at Camp in the Wyrm's Landing. Interact with your bedroll to go to bed. Your character will have trouble sleeping and when they're about to settle down, they'll be interrupted by the Voice of the Absolute ringing through their head. While you struggle to get your hand on the Artefact, you learn that the Absolute is rallying their forces to invade Baldur's Gate. The Dream Visitor then calls out to you, needing help from an attack and opens a portal to the Astral Plane. This begins the Personal Quest Help Your Protector.\n\nYou will be forced into combat against three Githyanki. Fighting them is not the main goal, however. On the right of your screen, you'll see a 3-turn countdown. You need to reach the portal within those three turns or the Absolute will take control of your mind. Make a beeline to the portal, ignoring the Githyanki attackers and you'll make it to the Astral Plane.\n\nNot all is well in the Astral Plane. When you enter, you'll find some more Githyanki warriors destroying the orb surrounding the skull and once again hear pleas from your Dream Visitor asking for help. Ahead on a platform below you, you'll find eight friendly Intellect Devourers fighting two Githyanki warriors. Hop down and defeat the warriors, then continue forward into the large skull. When you enter, you'll view a cutscene of a Mind Flayer fighting against several Githyanki. The Illithid will reveal that they were in fact your Dream Visitor and ask for help in defeating the Githyanki warriors. You'll have the following options when responding to it's request:\n\nWhat do you need me to do? Leave the githyanki alone! Prove to me that your are who you say. This is the battle you were fighting? I don't believe you. You're a mind flayer. Die, monster!\n\nIf you pick the fourth option, he will tell you that the warriors aim to free their master bound by chains and that you cannot let that happen. Agree, and you'll enter combat against four Githyanki warriors. After you defeat all four warriors the Mind Flayer, The Emperor, will thank you and explain that they are the reason you have not yet turned into a Mind Flayer yourself. You'll then have the following dialogue options:\n\nI ask again - who are you? And I'm going to need a name this time. Thank you for saving me. I always suspected you were a mind flayer. Why did you deceive me all this time? I prefer the other version of you. Tell me everything.\n\nIf you pick the first option, you'll learn more about who The Emperor was before being turned into a Mind Flayer. Your next set of choices will look like this:\n\nLord Gortash was one of the Chosen in the colony... Did you have to eat criminals' brains? So are you going to tell me what this battle was about? How did you end up in here? That githyanki in the sphere - who is it?\n\nThe first option is a free option, and lets you learn a little bit more about Gortash. Pick the fifth option, and he tells you a little bit about Orpheus, the bound githyanki prince, and how his powers are crucial to keeping your freedom from the Absolute. You will then have several options to ask about Orpheus and what you could do with him, as well as what The Emperor is doing in the Artefact. If you ask about freeing Orpheus, The Emperor states it's a bad idea and that the Githyanki prince will see you as a Mind Flayer as much as The Emperor is. You'll be able to give the following responses:\n\nWe're alike in other ways too. The more I talk to you, the less you seem like a mind flayer. I'm nothing like you. I'm no illithid, and will never be.\n\nIf you pick the second option, The Emperor will talk about the benefits of being a Mind Flayer and encourage you to become one as well. You'll be able to respond in the following ways:\n\nI would like that. Why do you say that? I don't like what you're implying... I'm trying to avoid becoming a mind flayer - I thought you agreed to protect me.\n\nPick the second option again and he offers to evolve the tadpole in your head to the next stage, enhancing your Illithid Powers in exchange for a slight change in appearance. You can freely ask him why he can't stop ceremorphosis, after which you'll have to agree or disagree to his offer. If you disagree, he understands and hopes you can defeat your foes without the need of enhanced Illithid abilities, but gives you the Astral-Touched Tadpole just in case you change your mind. This conversation will end Help Your Protector.\n\nHelp Your Protector Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
