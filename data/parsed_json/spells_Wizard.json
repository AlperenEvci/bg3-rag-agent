Wizards primary ability is Intelligence, their saving throw proficiencies are Intelligence & Wisdom and they have a Hit Dice of 1d6.

Wizards have very little in the way of Armour protection, and minimal Weapon Proficiencies, making them lean on their spells to support their party.\n\nThe Wizard is a spellcasting class in Dungeons & Dragons, and it also plays a significant role in Baldur's Gate 3. Wizards are distinguished by their extensive knowledge of arcane magic, which they acquire through rigorous study and the mastery of ancient tomes and spellbooks.\n\nUnlike Sorcerers who possess innate magical abilities, Wizards rely on their intellect, discipline, and education to cast spells. They delve into ancient texts, meticulously transcribing and memorizing magical formulae into their spellbooks.\n\nThrough this scholarly process, Wizards gain access to a diverse range of spells and the flexibility to prepare different ones each day, tailoring their magical arsenal to suit specific challenges.\n\nWizards master the arcane by specialising in individual schools of magic, combining ancient spells with modern research.\n\nBG3 Wizard Class Features\n\nHit Points at 1st Level: 6 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 4 + Constitution modifier\n\nArmour: None Weapons: Daggers, Quarterstaves, Light Crossbows Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom Skills: Choose any 2 Skills from - Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Religion\n\nSTARTING EQUIPMENT\n\nSimple Robe, Simple Boots Quarterstaff Health Potion x2, Scroll of Revivify\n\nWIZARD SPELLCASTING\n\nFull Spellcasters: Unlocks new spell level every 2 Wizard levels, up to level 6 spells.
