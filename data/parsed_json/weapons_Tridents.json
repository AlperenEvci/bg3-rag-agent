  "content": "Tridents in Baldur's Gate 3 are pieces of equipment that are used to inflict damage against hostile characters such as Enemies and Bosses. Tridents are Versatile Martial Weapons in BG3 that can be one-handed or two-handed, dealing 1-6 Damage when one-handed and 1-8 damage when two-handed. Tridents can additionally be Thrown, dealing the same damage they would when used for a melee attack. They have a melee range of 1.5m, and they deal Piercing Damage, though some special Tridents also deal another type of Damage as well.\n\nMany Tridents have unique properties, so you should read carefully what these do, and many also have Weapon Actions that can only be used if you are Proficient with Tridents in BG3. These Weapon Actions are Rush Attack, Piercing Strike, and Crippling Strike.\n\nBattleaxes Clubs Daggers Darts Flails Glaives Greataxes Greatclubs Greatswords Halberds Handaxes Hand Crossbows Heavy Crossbows Javelins Light Crossbows Light Hammers Longbows Longswords Maces Mauls Morningstars Pikes Quarterstaves Rapiers Scimitars Shortbows Shortswords Sickles Spears Tridents War Picks Warhammers\n\nAll Tridents in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nName Damage Special Properties Weapon Actions Trident 1d8 (1d6) Piercing None Rush Attack Piercing StrikeCrippling Strike Trident of the Depths (Permanently Armed by Water Myrmidon) 1d8 (1d6) +3 Piercing Weapon Enchantment +3 Hiemal Strike Trident +1 1d8 (1d6) +1 Piercing Weapon Enchantment +1 Rush AttackPiercing StrikeCrippling Strike Allandra's Whelm 1d8 (1d6) +2 Piercing +1d4 Cold Weapon Enchantment +2 Rush AttackPiercing StrikeCrippling Strike Frigid Blade The Sparky Points 1d8 (1d6) Piercing Electric Blood: When the wielder deals damage using this weapon, they gain 2 Lighting Charges.
