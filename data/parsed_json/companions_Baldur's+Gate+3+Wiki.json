Return to the legendary city of Baldur’s Gate® in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival and the lure of absolute power. Baldur's Gate 3 is developed and published by Larian Studios for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 5.

Players can expect to get their hands on the game on the 3rd of August, 2023 for the PC version, and on the 6th of September, 2023 for the PS5.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 features a new story with several familiar characters from the Dungeons & Dragons campaign. Choose from a wide selection of D&D races and classes, or play as an origin character with a hand-crafted background. Adventure, loot, battle and romance as you journey through the Forgotten Realms and beyond. Play alone, and select your companions carefully, or as a party of up to four in multiplayer. Baldur's Gate 3 follows the 5th Edition Ruleset from DnD.\n\nGather your party, and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power. Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a Mind Flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil. Abducted, infected, lost. You are turning into a monster, but as the corruption inside you grows, so does your power. That power may help you to survive, but there will be a price to pay, and more than any ability, the bonds of trust that you build within your party could be your greatest strength. Caught in a conflict between devils, deities, and sinister otherworldly forces, you will determine the fate of the Forgotten Realms together.\n\nThe Forgotten Realms are a vast, detailed and diverse world, and there are secrets to be discovered all around you -- verticality is a vital part of exploration.

Whether you're teaming up with PS5 players from your PC or diving into action with Mac users on your Xbox, Baldur’s Gate 3 is set to introduce complete cross-platform progression and cross-play, just as the gaming deities envisioned.\n\nWhen the update rolls out, you can invite friends to your cross-play lobby no matter what platform they're on. Plus, you can easily discover multiplayer lobbies with friends using the Larian Network, regardless of their system.\n\nModding Toolkit Update\n\nThe BG3 Mod Tools were initially released in September 2024, allowing players to create customized campaigns and content, including level editing, save editing, and more. In the recent Patch 8, the modding toolkit gets a new update to support partial level editing, enabling mod settings to create unique interactive objects and NPCs. This means that players can generate multiple objects that they can place anywhere on the map, override in-game template types in existing levels, and even add a script to an object by making it teleport away every time you get close to it (from the BG3 Patch Notes). However, modifications to dialogues and static world elements like terrain, buildings, and sceneries remain restricted.\n\nPhoto Mode makes its debut when Patch 8 launches. As described in Community Update #30, \"Baldur’s Gate 3’s Photo Mode is a little like a photo booth that lets you set up pretty much any shot you’d like. This new feature introduces a whole slew of options to let you customise and edit your in-game photography, with various levels of freedom depending on whether you’re using it while adventuring, or during combat, dialogue, and cinematic scenes.\"\n\nThe camera settings for Photo Mode can be toggled from the HUD, located near the minimap, or by using the hotkey binding (F9 on PC, and by pressing both analog sticks at the same time on console), you’ll get to choose which character you want to take center stage, determine their best side, and adjust the camera position to suit. Players can also adjust the angle and sort out the lends by tinkering with the Field of View, Exposure, Depth of Field, and Focus.\n\nPhoto Mode for BG3 will also allow players to set the scene. Toggle on and off to remove NPCs, Enemies, your party, and even yourself! Apart from that, players will be delighted to choose facial expressions, plus a range of over 40 static and animated poses, each with multiple variations to help give you the perfect layout.\n\nAnd of course, Photo Mode would not be complete without Post Processing Effects, adding Frames, and Stickers! Be unique and creative with your shots by experimenting with contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness, and vignettes. Add that extra material by adding a range of different frames, and to top it off, you also get to pick from over 300 stickers and add up to 30 to your scene, including emojis, icons, blood splatters, textures, objects, and items, and... CAT EARS!\n\nBug Fixes and Improvements in Patch 8\n\nPatch 8 also includes fixes to tackle a wide range of bugs, including visual bugs, Cerys's combat bugs, and issues when it comes to moving platforms during the Gauntlet of Shar. There are also improvements and fixes for Gameplay, Combat, Modding, Performance and Options, Scripting and Flow, Crashes, and more. There are also some reworks to Features and Spells, to address Combat and Balance across Acts, and certain Acts specifically. One change mentioned is the rework on Potent Spellcasting, which now makes it affect Bursting Sinew and Toll the Dead.\n\nCombat and Gameplay Mechanics for Baldur's Gate 3\n\nCharacter Creation in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 features an extensive Character Creation menu that lets you fully customize not only the looks of your character, but also their background and identity. Players will be guided through an informative step-by-step process that allows new players to Dungeons & Dragons and other Larian Studios titles to have a full understanding of the choices they are making and to fully immerse themselves into the role of their character. Character Creation is a vital first step in playing the game as the choices you make will affect how the world reacts to you, and vice versa, how you interact with the world.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Character Origins\n\nThe first step to creating a character is to choose from one of 7 Origins. These origins can be considered as pre-made characters, with each character having their own unique story, goals, personalities, and quirks. Origins come with pre-chosen Races, Backgrounds and Classes. Some players may opt to make their own custom characters instead, but you may miss out on character specific events and dialogue choices. Any Origin characters you and your party members don't pick can be encountered while playing the game and become your companions.\n\nThere is one Origin that does not feature a predetermined character — The Dark Urge. This brand new Origin is the first of it's kind in Larian games. Rather than having a set backstory and end objective, this Origin introduces and explores the darker impulses that a player may have when playing a role-playing game. Your character will have no recollection of the past besides walking down a path paved with blood. As you venture on, your character will find themselves inescapably drawn towards unimaginable cruelties. Can you resist these urges? You sure can, but you may miss the special dialogue and cutscenes associated with the Origin. As a character with The Dark Urge, players can freely customize their character's Race, Background, and Class.\n\nPlayable Races in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nAnyone familiar with Dungeons & Dragons knows that the game gives you a myriad of unique choices when it comes to choosing which Races you can play as. Baldur's Gate 3 allows players to play as 11 of DnD's most popular Races — the Dragonborn, Drow, Dwarves, Elves, Githyanki, Gnomes, Half-Elves, Half-Orcs, Halflings, Humans, and Tieflings.\n\nEach Race has a set of Racial Features; Race-specific abilities and perks that range from being proficient in certain weapons, to being able to see in the dark, to simply having access to spells that you otherwise wouldn't have access to from your class spell list. In addition, each Race is granted a boost to certain Abilities, increasing your character's stats and proficiencies in performing certain actions. These Race-specific features make choosing your Race an important decision during Character Creation as some Races may be better suited to some Classes than other Races.\n\nWhich Class to Pick in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nAnother big decision in creating your character in Baldur's Gate 3 is choosing which Class to play. Baldur's Gate 3 features 12 D&D Classes to choose from — Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard. You will then be able to pick from a pool of three or more sub-Classes, of which there are 46 in total across all Classes. When you will have to choose your sub-Class will depend on your main Class. Some require you to choose a sub-Class in Character Creation, while others only give you a choice after reaching a certain character level.\n\nJust like in Dungeons & Dragons, players will be able to multiclass, i.e. adopt two different Classes at the same time. While there are a lot of great combinations of Class proficiencies and abilities that you can get from multiclassing, there are some drawbacks you should be aware of. Firstly, Class levels will have to be split among both Classes. Players will have a level cap of 12 and the total Class level of both classes cannot exceed this, meaning that you may not be able to reach the full potential of either class you are multiclassing. In addition, you may find that not all Classes will synergize with each other and may find yourself weaker than if you were to focus on a single Class.\n\nDespite this, you are encouraged to experiment and explore any Class combinations you can think up. Players will be able to reset and change their Class at an NPC that has not yet been revealed. Unlike in DnD where you have to have a certain Ability Score to be able to swap classes, Baldur's Gate 3 does not have any restrictions and you can swap between Classes freely without losing any character levels.\n\nCompanions & Romance in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nCompanions in Baldur's Gate 3 are special NPCs that can be recruited to join the player's party. They have their own set of stats, abilities, equipment, lore, alignments, and more, making them unique from one another. There are several other Companions you can meet other than the unpicked Origin characters. Throughout the game, players will meet possible NPCs that can be recruited as a Companion who joins your party if their corresponding conditions are met. Unlike in Divinity: Original Sin II, Companions can be recruited even with a full party. These Companions can be found at Camp and can be swapped into the main party roster whenever you visit camp. After the first Act, however, your main party of 4 will have to be set.\n\nYour companions will each have different objectives and reactions to the actions you choose. Learning what they approve of and helping them reach their goals is the first step to developing a Romance with them. The developers at Larian Studios hoped to make a Romance system that was more realistic, building up throughout each act rather than having them happen at set points in the game. The bonds that you develop with your Companions can become so strong that they can be persuaded to follow you even if your path does not align with their beliefs.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Combat Basics\n\nBaldur's Gate 3's Combat mechanics are heavily inspired by Dungeons & Dragons. To put it simply, dice rolls determine how successful you are in performing actions during combat. In more detail, the game features a robust and dynamic combat system that combines aspects of turn-based combat with real-time action. Like in Divinity: Original Sin II, players can freely move their characters during exploration, and when approaching an enemy encounter, the game seamlessly transitions into turn-based combat mode.\n\nAs noted earlier, dice rolls determine almost everything in combat. The first thing it determines is the turn order. Each character within the encounter - players, companions, and enemies alike - roll a 20-sided die, commonly referred to as the D20, to determine their Initiative. Everyone adds their Dexterity Modifier, and their position in the turn order depends on how high the resulting number is.\n\nOn your turn, you will get to choose an action to take. For offensive moves, one of two possible dice rolls have to be made depending on the action. Most attacks will require an Attack Roll. A D20 will be rolled and the sum of the dice roll plus your weapon/spell proficiency will be compared to your opponent's Armor Class (AC). Roll higher than their AC and your attack hits. Roll lower and it misses. Some attacks require Saving Throws from opponent(s) instead of an Attack Roll. Affected enemies will roll a D20 and add the required modifier to the roll. It will be compared to your corresponding Difficulty Class (DC) and should they roll higher, the attack completely fails or it's effects are halved.\n\nOn a successful hit, another dice roll will determine how much damage your skill does. Of course, your damage is not completely left up to chance. You will have several set modifiers that will be added to your rolls, and as you get higher in level, these modifiers (and sometimes the number of dice you can roll) will increase.\n\nFor any dice roll you make with a D20, whether it be in combat or out of combat, rolling a 20 is considered an automatic success, while rolling a 1 an automatic failure (with the exception of Initiative).\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Difficulty Settings\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 will have three difficulty settings similar to those found in Divinity: Original Sin II. The 'default' mode is Balanced Mode, a mode with just enough storytelling and a good amount of combat for players to experience. For players who are more invested into the game's storytelling & cinematics and would like easier and shorter enemy encounters, Explorer Mode is the one for you.\n\nThe difficulty mode which may excite veterans of Divinity: Original Sin II is the returning Tactician Mode. Tactician mode is designed for experienced players who seek challenging and strategic experiences. In the mode, players will encounter enemies with what Larian Studios like to refer to as Brutal AI. Enemy creatures become stronger and more adept at countering player tactics. They will use advanced strategies, exploit weaknesses and coordinate attacks to make battles more difficult. An example of this is an enemy specifically targeting the character with the lowest health. In addition to this, the environment will become more lethal. Puzzles and traps become more complex, additional environmental hazards such as explosive barrels will be scattered across enemy encounters, more enemies may appear in hard-to-reach areas of arena etc. In Tactician Mode, players will need to approach encounters with a well-thought-out-plan, utilizing the strengths and abilities of every one of their party members.\n\nFor players enjoy challenge, there's also Honour mode. Bosses will have stronger Legendary Actions (actions that the boss can take at the end of another creature's turn.) Your team will have less economy and damage bonuses as the game progresses. More importantly, you only gets a single save file for the entire campaign. If you die, either continue the campaign in Custom mode, which ends Honour mode. Or end the campaign, which deletes the save.\n\nCustom difficulty lets the player tweak various gameplay elements to their liking. Custom Mode settings with the exception of two can be changed at any time. However the player cannot revert back to the original Explorer, Balanced or Tactician difficulty. The 'default' values displayed will be those of the difficulty level you were on prior to selecting Custom.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Story & Exploration\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 takes place 100 years after the events in Baldur’s Gate 2 and shortly after the events of Descent into Avernus. The holy city of Elturel disappeared from the Forgotten Realms and descended into Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. In the canon of the game, it was saved by a party of heroes. Baldur's Gate 3 opens with a cinematic of a Mind Flayer infecting a woman with an Illithid parasite on a Nautiloid. Your character is infected with the same parasite and after crash landing the aircraft on Faerûn, you go an adventure in search of a way to cure yourself. As you make your way across the Forgotten Realms, you are given a choice between resisting the temptation of the power offered by the Illithid tadpole, or fully embracing it.\n\nThroughout your journey, you will meet countless NPCs, each with different beliefs, alignments, and their own story to tell. Complete quests, reach key story turning points, and finish each story arc to make your mark on the world. Everything you do will eventually make its way back to the city of Baldur's Gate. You will hear the residents of the bustling city making comments on current events and the local Gazette will constantly be updated with your feats. Areas from different story acts will be interconnected, allowing you to go back and travel back to areas you have visited with ease.\n\nOf course, you will be able to take breaks in between your adventures. Take a detour to go Digging for unique equipment and rare treasure. Make a stop at Camp to take a Short or Long Rest and speak with your Companions to further your bond with them. Get sidetracked and complete Companion Quests and other Side Quests before moving on to the next Main Quest.\n\nBG3 WIKI GUIDE - SPELL MECHANICS\n\nSpells in BG3 are magical abilities that characters can use to cast various enchantments, attacks, and utility effects. These spells are typically divided into different schools of magic, such as evocation for offensive spells, abjuration for protective spells, and enchantment for control spells, among others. Spells can be learned and cast by characters who have the appropriate class and spellcasting abilities, like wizards, sorcerers, clerics, and druids, among others.\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, understanding concentration is vital for spellcasting. You can focus on only one spell at a time, and casting another spell that requires concentration ends the previous one. You can choose to cancel concentration voluntarily.\n\nResting is crucial for your party's well-being and comes in two forms: Long Rest and Short Rest. To take a Long Rest, gather camp supplies, like food and scrap, which you can acquire through various means. Having enough food keeps your party fed and ready. When supplies are low, opt for a Partial Rest to regain some Hit Points and Spell Slots without using up your food.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions for Baldur's Gate 3\n\nWhat platforms is Baldur's Gate 3 available on?\n\nThe game is currently available on multiple platforms, including PC (Steam and GOG), PlayStation 5 and GeForce Now.\n\nCan I play Baldur's Gate 3 offline?\n\nYes, you can play the game offline.
