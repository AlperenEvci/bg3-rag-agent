  "content": "Damage in Baldur's Gate 3, is mostly caused by attacks meant to deplete a target's hit points to defeat it. Whether the damage be caused by physical attacks, spells, or elemental hazards, it has a corresponding damage type and every creature may have resistances or vulnerabilities that determine how much damage is sustained from certain types of damage.\n\nBludgeoning Piercing Slashing Acid Cold Fire Force Lightning Necrotic Poison Psychic Radiant Thunder\n\nBludgeoning, Piercing and Slashing are sometimes referred to collectively as PHYSICAL damage.\n\nDamage Resistance, Vulnerability and Immunity\n\nResistance: If a creature or an object is RESISTANT to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. Vulnerability: If a creature or an object is VULNERABLE to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it. Immunity: If a creature or object is IMMUNE to a damage type, damage of that type is completely negated.Resistances and Vulnerabilities do not stack, but can negate each other.",
