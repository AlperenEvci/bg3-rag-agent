Help the Cursed Monk can be acquired during Act 1. Completing Help the Cursed Monk will progress the story forward.\n\nHelp the Cursed Monk Objectives\n\nFind the lost amulet\n\nWe read the journal of a Dark Justiciar. He mentioned an amulet of great power that also made the wearer laugh. It was cast into lava.\n\nTravel to Wyrm's Crossing\n\nTravel to Baldur's Gate: We found a cursed amulet possessed by a spirit. He wants to be returned to his granddaughter in Baldur's Gate.\n\nFind Shirra Clarwen\n\nWe reached the Open Harnd Temple.

To start the quest, head to the \"isle\" ahead, you can find an Adamantine Chest (X: -626, Y: 224. DC 25), that contains a Sentient Amulet. When you grab the Amulet, it will talk to you and grant you this quest. You need to pass the checks to resist the urge to laugh. If you passed perception and religion checks you will find out the ghost trapped inside the amulet is a Lathander worshiper. (Shadowheart will suggest you leave the amulet) When you reach Rivington in Act 3, you can return the amulet to Shirra in the Basement of Open Hand Temple. Once you return the amulet to Shirra, the ghost inside will possess her body, and ask you if you would take on his madness so he may pass on You can make an optional arcana check to see what the consequences of accepting his madness is. If you agree to accept his madness you will have to make 2 saving throws or you will get a debuff called Monk's Madness which grants a -1 or -2 to your wisdom score depending on if you succeeded on the saving throws. If you decline to take on his madness you will have to fight him. he will possess the 3 other bodies in the room and set them on you. If you focus on Shirra the battle ends when her body dies.\n\nHelp the Cursed Monk Rewards\n\nTasha's Hideous Laughter as an Action at the potential cost of wisdom\n\nHelp the Cursed Monk Notes & Tips\n\nUpon picking up the amulet you will need to pass a medium DC wisdom saving throw or begin to laugh.
