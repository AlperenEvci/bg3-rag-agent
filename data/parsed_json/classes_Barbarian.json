For beginners, the Berserker subclass offers straightforward mechanics and strength, making you more powerful. Alternatively, the Wildheart subclass can provide more dynamic options like Wolf Heart, which grants advantage to melee allies against enemies you're adjacent to. Activate Rage to deal more damage and gain Resistance to various types of damage, enhancing your combat endurance. At level 1, Barbarians gain the Unarmored Defense feature, increasing their Armor Class by their Constitution modifier when not wearing armor. If you're playing an unarmored Barbarian, focus on boosting both Constitution and Dexterity stats to enhance your Armor Class. Using a two-handed weapon is generally more advantageous for Barbarians, providing greater damage potential. Consider picking up the Great Weapon Master feat at level 4 for added damage and a bonus action on kills or critical hits. Use Reckless Attack to gain an advantage on attacks, but be aware that enemies also gain an advantage against you.\n\nClasses Arcane Trickster ♦ Archfey ♦ Assassin ♦ Bard ♦ Battle Master ♦ Beast Master ♦ Berserker ♦ Circle of Spores ♦ Circle of the Land ♦ Circle of the Moon ♦ Circle of the Spores ♦ Cleric ♦ College of Lore ♦ College of Swords ♦ College of Valour ♦ Conjuration School ♦ Divination School ♦ Draconic Bloodline ♦ Druid ♦ Eldritch Knight ♦ Enchantment School ♦ Fighter ♦ Gloom Stalker ♦ Hunter ♦ Illusion School ♦ Knowledge Domain ♦ Life Domain ♦ Light Domain ♦ Monk ♦ Nature Domain ♦ Necromancy School ♦ Oath of the Ancients ♦ Oath of Vengeance ♦ Oathbreaker ♦ Paladin ♦ Path of the Giant ♦ Ranger ♦ Rogue ♦ Sorcerer ♦ Storm Sorcery ♦ Tempest Domain ♦ The Fiend ♦ The Great Old One ♦ Thief ♦ Transmutation School ♦ Trickery Domain ♦ War Domain ♦ Warlock ♦ Way of Shadow ♦ Wild Magic ♦ Wild Magic (Barbarian) ♦ Wizard",
