Feats are special talents or expertises that provide special capabilities to characters. At certain levels, your character will get to choose between an Ability Score Improvement Feature or a Feat.\n\nLucky Information\n\nYou gain 3 Luck Points, which you can use to gain Advantage on Attack Rolls, Ability Checks, or Saving Throws, or to make an enemy reroll their Attack Rolls. This feature replenishes at the end of a long rest. Lucky is handled mechanically like a Reaction, but doesn't actually expend your Reaction.\n\nHow to unlock Lucky\n\nYou'll need to fulfill the following requirements to unlock Lucky All Classes at Level 4\n\nAll Classes at Level 4\n\nLucky Tips & Notes\n\nWhat's great about this feat is that it's handled like a reaction (but does not cost a reaction). You don't have to anticipate missing; you can use it only if you miss an attack, fail a check, or a saving throw, or if an enemy is about to hit you. It can significantly impact battles, especially tougher ones. Due to frequent long rests, you'll have these points back relatively quickly.\n\nRecharges on Long Rest\n\nAll Feats in Baldur's Gate 3 Ability Improvements ♦ Actor ♦ Alert ♦ Athlete ♦ Charger ♦ Crossbow Expert ♦ Defensive Duellist ♦ Dual Wielder ♦ Dungeon Delver ♦ Durable ♦ Elemental Adept ♦ Great Weapon Master ♦ Heavily Armoured ♦ Heavy Armour Master ♦ Lightly Armoured ♦ Mage Slayer ♦ Magic Initiate: Bard ♦ Magic Initiate: Cleric ♦ Magic Initiate: Druid ♦ Magic Initiate: Sorcerer ♦ Magic Initiate: Warlock ♦ Magic Initiate: Wizard ♦ Martial Adept ♦ Medium Armour Master ♦ Mobile ♦ Moderately Armoured ♦ Observant ♦ Performer ♦ Polearm Master ♦ Resilient ♦ Ritual Caster ♦ Savage Attacker ♦ Sentinel ♦ Sharpshooter ♦ Shield Master ♦ Skilled ♦ Spell Sniper ♦ Tavern Brawler ♦ Tough ♦ Unstable Blood ♦ War Caster ♦ Weapon Master",
