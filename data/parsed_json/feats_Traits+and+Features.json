  "content": "Traits and Features In Baldur's Gate 3, refer to the unique actions and attributes that a character can perform and obtain depending on their Class and Race or Subrace. The Traits are acquired only by specific Races while Features are available to any character and are determined by their Class. Each Class also has several Subclasses that players can select after gaining sufficient XP. In the list below, we combined the full Traits and Features in one table that will allow players to compare actions and attributes.\n\nHow do I acquire Traits and Features in BG3?\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, Traits are acquired by characters through their Race which gives them a unique attribute that cannot be obtained by other means. Some races also have subraces that will give them another attribute different from other subraces while retaining the attributes from their original race. Once players have chosen their character's race, it can no longer be changed.\n\nOn the other hand, Features can be obtained by any character, and are determined by their Class. Classes also have subclasses that players can choose after gaining the required experience. Players can choose to respec their class if they wish to do so and the Full Launch of Baldur's Gate 3 will now introduce Multiclassing.\n\nCan I Change my Class to get other Features in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nPlayers are encouraged to try different combinations and Classes to find a Build that best suits them to create a fun and enjoyable experience. This is done through the same NPC that is met in early act 1 who will have a few helpful abilities including the ability to restart your Build with new starting proficiencies, attributes, spells, and cantrips.\n\nFor concerns about balancing a party composition, you don't have to worry about choosing the right class for your character when it comes to party composition as all Companions can be respecced to any other class. So you actually have the freedom of choosing your preferred class without worrying about whether it would synergize well with your companions.\n\nDo note that respeccing your companion's class will not affect them in any way in terms of story, origin, or lore. For example, if you have Wyll as a companion and you decided to respecc and change him into a different class, he will still be a Warlock story-wise.\n\nAre Features Different from Feats in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nFeats in Baldur's Gate 3 are special talents or areas of expertise that provide special capabilities to characters. Each Feat is unique, giving you an extra passive or active skill that you would not have gotten otherwise through your chosen Class or Background. These Feats can range from increases in Ability Scores, to proficiencies that give you an edge in battle, to skill bonuses that are best suited for out-of-combat scenarios.\n\nYou can take any Feat regardless of your Class or Race, so long as you meet its required prerequisite. If you ever lose a Feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that Feat until you regain the prerequisite. An example the game and the Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook gives is regarding the Grappler feat.\n\nThis Feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 by any means —perhaps by a withering curse— you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored back to the prerequisite of 13.\n\nMulticlassing in BG3 and How Does it Work?\n\nMulticlassing is a feature that will be implemented in the full release of Baldur's Gate 3. This is the ability to switch to another Class and can be done in-game. In order to allow all your wildest dream class combinations, Larian removed Ability Score Prerequisites. So there's no more need to get your Charisma up to a pesky 13 if you decide to make a soul pact with a playful Archfey or dangerous Fiend. You can Multiclass into anything your roleplay and build desires demand. In short, this means Warriors will be able to wield arcane spells, Rogues can master divine magic, Spellcasters may dabble in martial prowess, and you’ll have the freedom to build the exact class that you want. While Multiclassing can be powerful, it may also spread your character's ability thin, so it's best that you plan and prepare ahead when you consider multiclassing.\n\nAll Baldur's Gate 3 Traits and Features\n\nYou can search by Name, Type, Requirement, or Description.
