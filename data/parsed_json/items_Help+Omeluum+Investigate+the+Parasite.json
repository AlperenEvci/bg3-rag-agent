Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earning more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nHelp Omeluum Investigate the Parasite Objectives\n\nLet Omeluum examine the parasite\n\nWe mentioned the parasite to Blurg, a hobgoblin. His colleague, a mind flayer named Omeluum, offered to examine it. Perhaps it can cure us?\n\nAsk Omeluum how to negate the tadpole's magic\n\nThe mind flayer couldn't extract the parasite, but offered us a way to negate the magic protecting it.\n\nFind the mushrooms Omeluum requested\n\nTo help us, Omeluum requires a Tongue of Madness mushroom and some Timmask Spores. We can find both of these in the mysterious tower nearby. We found the Tongue of Madness. We'll need to bring it back to Omeluum along with the Timmask Spores. We found some Timmask Spores. We'll need to bring them back to Omeluum once we find the Tongue of Madness. We lost some of the mushrooms that Omeluum asked for. We'll have to find some replacements before it can help us. The tower belongs to a cleric of Mystra named Lenore. She is fond of gardening and experimenting on plants such as the Susser Tree.\n\nDrink the potion Omeluum made\n\nBefore Omeluum can start the procedure, we'll need to drink a potion it made from the mushrooms we found.\n\nGet the Ring of Mind-Shielding from Omeluum\n\nThe potion Omeluum gave us only made the parasite stronger - unlocking a strange, new power. To calm it down, Omeluum is willing to trade us a Ring of Mind-Shielding.\n\nQuest Complete Description\n\nWe've acquired Omeluum's Ring of Mind-Shielding. It might protect its wearer from the parasite's influence We left the area before Omeluum could help. We'll need to find a cure somewhere else.
