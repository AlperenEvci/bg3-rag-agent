Return the stolen locket.\n\nReturn the Locket Walkthrough\n\nWhen your team first enters the Hollow (near X:167 Y:542), you find the Tiefling kid Meli stealing a locket from Barth. If you don't intervene, Barth will eventually attack Meli and be dragged away by the guards. You can intervene by speaking to Barth or Meli. If you side with Meli, he will escape. If you side with Barth, you can use INTIMIDATION or persuasion (DC5) to make Meli return the locket. You can also ask Meli why he steal the locket. He will admit that it reminded him of his deceased mother. Barth will gift the locket to Meli. Alternatively, you can steal the locket back from Meli and return it to Barth. If Meli already escaped, you can find the locket in a thief's chest inside the Tiefling hideout. You can steal it back and give to Barth.\n\nHow to unlock Return the Locket\n\nMeet Barth and Meli in the Hollow.\n\nReturn the Locket Rewards\n\n15 XP, 6-7 gold to each party member, favor of some persons from a party, for example, Shadowheart. Wyll doesn't.\n\nReturn the Locket Notes & Tips\n\nYou must start the cutscene near X:167 Y:542, The Hollow, where Tefling Meli is stealing something from Barth. After you have options, be careful; now, the quest seems broken. So, do exactly what is written below. Or you will ruin the quest. Use Save/Load. When you speak with somebody (with the thief Meli or Barth) by one person, you can decide whether to help the boy or not with the Locket. The best option is to help the boy and get +25 XP and rude Barth. You won't get in the Quest Journal information about this quest, cause when you speak with Barth - he is angry. Option №1 When you see the cutscene before the boy leaves this place - you can steal another person this Locket back only from Potion of Invisibility or Magic Invisibility and, after the cutscene, return it to Barth. But the \"return Locker\" option will be only if you speak by the person who started to speak in the first cutscene. In this dialog, you can figure out the secret of this Locket. Option №2 You don't steal back Locker. And see, just running Meli. When next time you are in Thiefling Hideout, you will be the hero there cause you helped Thiefling Meli if you have chosen that scenario. If you speak with Meli through the person you helped in dialog with Barth - you will get the option: TELL ME THE TRUTH. THAT ANDENTURE'S LOCKET - DO YOU HAVE IT? But Meli won't give you back. The locket is near, in Thief's Stash. And only when you find your locker inside Stash and get it - Quest will be able in your Journal. You back to Barth and return it to the person who started to speak in the first cutscene. Option №3 You try to steal Locker and have not succeeded. The cutscene is interrupted. And you see, just running Meli again, and at that moment, you see the quest in your journal and get +15 XP. Very strange. Only now do you have additional options for dialog with Barth in the quest to get back the Locker cause you didn't defend a boy, and you didn't help to return the Locker in a peaceful way. When next time you are in Thiefling Hideout, you will not be the hero there cause you didn't help Thiefling. The locket is near, in Thief's Stash, as before. And when you find your locker inside Stash and get it - you will have an update in Quest Journal. You back to Barth and return it to the person who started to speak in the first cutscene. Option №4 You steal Locker before you start to speak with them. You will have an option in a dialog like \"I was more deft. Take your Locker.\" You will get +15 XP.\n\nThe problem is that you don't have comprehension that you have this quest in normal ways.\n\nNotes & tips go here.\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
