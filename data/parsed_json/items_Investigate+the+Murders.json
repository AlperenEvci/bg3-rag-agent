Investigate the Murders can be acquired during Act 3 and is part of the overall quest to Get Orin's Netherstone. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3 and earn more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nInvestigate the Murders Walkthrough\n\nYou can learn that a serious murders happened in Baldur's Gate from Gortash, or step into murder scenes of Duke Belynne Stelmane on 2nd floor of Elfsong Tarven. If you complete quest Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders, inspector Valeria also directs to Elfsong Tarven. There are multiple crime scenes you can investigate in Baldur's Gate. And you can collect the body parts of Dribbles the Clown in these scenes. On upper floor of Fraygo's Flophouse, use Speak with the Dead on Ffion Goldgrind reveals that the murderer is her son Dolor, who killed killed her after she found he is a serial killer. (Quest Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion) In the secret room in Fraygo's Flophouse (require key with a flower motif from quest Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders, or Knock spell, or lockpick DC 25). You can find a Bloodstained Parchment， which contains the murder list. (You can give it to Valeria or Devella as hard evidence of a Bhaalist plot.) The murder list are: Father Lorgan (Deceased): In the infirmary of the Open Hand Temple. Duke Belynne Stelmane (Deceased): Upper floor of the Elfsong Tavern. Alexander Rainforest (Deceased): In a bed on the top floor of Rainforest's Home. Franc Peartree (Deceased): On the ground in Peartree's Home. Cora Highberry (alive): Found at The Wine Festival. Figaro Pennygood (alive): Inside Facemaker's Boutique. Chef Roveer (alive).: In the kitchen of the Elfsong Tavern. Nesha Leesha (alive): Outside of the Blushing Mermaid. You can warn Chef Roveer about the murder polt, but he seems not take it seriously and give you a quest to clear the rats in basement. (Quest Roveer's Storehouse) You can find Nesha Leesha at the dock near Blushing Mermaid. You need to pass a Persuasion check DC 15 to convince her she is in danger. When you reach the Wine Festival in Lower City, speak to Cora Highberry and you will notice that the wine is poisoned if you succeed in the perception check. Stop her from drinking forces \"Master Meztli\" to reveal himself as serial killer Dolor. Dolor will try to escape with dimision door and leave you to fight some doppelgangers(drop Tombstone Shop Key). If you can kill him here (by counter Dolor's spell or finish him in 1 turn), you stopped the killing and can learn how to enter Candulhallow's Tombstones. Read the note on Dolor and take the hands of his victims, you need these to enter the Temple of Bhaal. If you failed to stop him, you can still learn the identity of this serial from investigating other crime scenes. Read the notes on these scenes, cast Speak with Dead spells, or talk with the animals all gives you the lead you need. Figaro Pennygood can be found in Facemaker's Boutique. If you failed to kill Dolor at Wine Festival, you can fight him here. Alternatively, instead of stoping the murders, you can kill the victims on the list by yourself. After you killed 2 vicitms, Olfaith Olumssdottir will direct you to Canduhallow's Tombstones and a passoword \"Sicarius\". After you learned the password and get the bag of hands from Dolor, head to Murder Tribunal from Canduhallow's Tombstones. You need to remove the Painting called Butterfly on Skull, and press the button to reveal the entrance.\n\nFather Lorgan (Deceased): In the infirmary of the Open Hand Temple. Duke Belynne Stelmane (Deceased): Upper floor of the Elfsong Tavern. Alexander Rainforest (Deceased): In a bed on the top floor of Rainforest's Home. Franc Peartree (Deceased): On the ground in Peartree's Home. Cora Highberry (alive): Found at The Wine Festival. Figaro Pennygood (alive): Inside Facemaker's Boutique. Chef Roveer (alive).: In the kitchen of the Elfsong Tavern. Nesha Leesha (alive): Outside of the Blushing Mermaid.\n\nYou need to hand in bag of hands from Dolor (Investigate the Murders) or the hand of Gortash to gain entry to Murder Tribunal. Or you can fight That Which Guards. In the Murder Tribunal, you will face Sarevok Anchev (Final Boss of BG1 and a Child of Bhaal), Echo of Sendai (Drow Bhaalspawn, boss of BG2:TOB ), Echo of Illasera (Bhaalspawn, boss of BG2:TOB) and the Echo of Amelyssan (final boss of BG2:TOB). Either prove to them you are a holy assassin of Bhaal by killing hollyphant investigator, Valeria. (And Minsc and Jaheira if they are with you.) Or defeat Sarevok (Lv 16 fighter). Afterwards, you get Amulet of Bhaal, which is necessary to enter Temple of Bhaal.\n\nInvestigate the Murders Objectives\n\nFollow the bloody trail of murders in Baldur's Gate.\n\nGortash told us how to find Orin the Red - follow the spate of murders across the city. The Open Hand Temple may be a good place to start.\n\nInvestigate the murder of Duke Stelmane.\n\nDuke Stelmane was ritualistically killed at the Elfsong Tavern shortly before our arrival into the city. We should investigate - it may help us find the Lord of Murder's Chosen.\n\nFind the unsually elaborate murder scene.\n\nThe Flaming Fist have found elaborate, ritualistic murder scenes around the city. They could be Bhaalist - and could lead us to Orin. Gauntlet Devella asked us to check out an elaborate murder scene that could be Bhaalist in nature. It could lead us to Orin the Red.\n\nShow the Bhaalist target list to the Investigator\n\nFather Lorgan's name appears on a target list we found - tying his murder into a test for cultists to access the Temple of Bhaal. We should Investigator Valeria.\n\nTalk to Gauntlet Devella in the Elfsong Tavern.\n\nInvestigator Valeria is now convinced Father Lorgan's murder is linked to a wider plot - and has asked us to bring the news to her constable, Gauntlet Devella, in the Lower City's Elfsong Tavern. We found a target list for Bhaalist assassins hoping to access the Temple of Bhaal - presumably where we'll find Orin. Duke Stelmane's on this list. We should inform Gauntlet Devella.\n\nFind the victims on the Bhaalist target list.\n\nWe found a list of targets for Bhaalist murderers - the only victims left alive are in the Lower City. The murderers following this list are trying to gain access to the Temple of Bhaal, presumably where we'll find Orin. We confirmed Franc Peartree was dead, as the Bhaalist target list noted. We should check on the other victims too. One of the victims from the Bhaalist target list told us his killer was dressed in red. We should track down the remaining victims before they strike again. We confirmed Alexander Rainforest was dead, as the Bhaalist target list noted. We should check on the other victims too. One of the victims from the Bhaalist target list told us his killer was dressed in red. We should track down the remaining victims before they strike again. A talkative rat in a Bhaalist victim's cellar saw the murderer - a dwarf dressed in red. We should track down the remaining victims before they strike again. Chef Roveer is dead by our hands - we should check in on the other victims from the Bhaalist target list. We warned Chef Roveer of the Bhaalist target list he's on - we should do the same for the other marked targets. Nesha Leesha is dead by our hands - we should check in on the other victims from the Bhaalist target list. We warned Nesha Leesha of the Bhaalist target list she's on - we should do the same for the other marked targets. Figaro Pennygood is dead by our hands - we should check in on the other victims from the Bhaalist target list.

Gauntlet Devella is convinced the target list we found is linked to a wider Bhaalist plot. She asked us to follow the people noted on the list, save them if possible, and get more information about the Bhaalist cult.\n\nChase down the serial killer.\n\nWe discovered Cora Highberry, one of the people noted on the Bhaalist target list, slaughtered brutally. Figaro Pennygood is next on the list - we need to find him before the killer does. We saved Cora Highberry from a Bhaalist serial killer disguised as a wine merchant. Figaro Pennygood is next on the target list - we need to find him before the killer does. Cora Highberry was slaughtered by a Bhaalist serial killer disguised as a wine merchant. Figaro Pennygood is next on the target list - we need to find him before the killer does. We stopped a spree of murders by taking down the killer - a dwarf named Dolor. We should check his body for any clues about finding the Bhaalist cult.\n\nFollow the serial killer.\n\nThe next victim on the Bhaalist target list is the late Figaro Pennygood. We should check his place - see if the killer stopped by and left any clues.\n\nEnter Candulhallow's Tombstones.\n\nWe found a note on Figaro Pennygood's corpse instructing his killer to enter Candulhallow's Tombstones with a passphrase - seems as though the Bhaalist cult may be there. We found a note in the killer Dolor's pockets, instructing him to enter Candulhallow's Tombstones with a passphrase - seems the Bhaalist cult may be there. We learned the passphrase we must speak at Candulhallow's Tombstones to meet with the Bhaalist cult.\n\nInfiltrate the Murder Tribunal.\n\nWe spoke the passphrase to enter Candulhallow's Tombstones - we should explore within to find the Bhaal cult.\n\nDebrief with the Investigator.\n\nJustice Sarevok is dead by our hands - we should speak to his hollyphant captive before heading to the Temple of Bhaal.\n\nQuest Complete Descriptions\n\nInvestigator Valeria told us where to find the Temple of Bhaal - Orin awaits us there. With Justice Sarevok and Investigator Valeria dead, we must search the Tribunal for a way of accessing the Temple of Bhaal. We became Unholy Assassins of Bhaal at the cost of Investigator Valeria's life - we wetted ourselves with her blood and were granted a way to access the Temple of Bhaal. We defeated the Justice Sarevok and his Murder Tribunal, stopping the serial killings in Baldur's Gate for now. To end them for good, we must find Orin. Justice Sarevok is dead by our hands - we can use his amulet to enter the Temple of Bhaal.\n\nHow to unlock Investigate the Murders\n\nAcquired after Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders and talk to Inspector Valeria.\n\nInvestigate the Murders Rewards\n\nInvestigate the Murders Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
