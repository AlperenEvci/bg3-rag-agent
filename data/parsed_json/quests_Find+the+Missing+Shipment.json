Find the Missing Shipment can be acquired during Act 1. Completing Find the Missing Shipment will progress the story forward.\n\nFind the Missing Shipment Objectives\n\nHelp the trapped survivors\n\nFind the Missing Shipment Walkthrough\n\nOnce you've crossed the bridge, continue your journey until you encounter a sight on the right side – a set of Mangled Corpses located at (X:-1, Y:516). Approach the corpses and engage with the surviving Hyena. A cutscene will unfold, depicting the Hyena in evident distress. Here, you'll have the opportunity to choose from a variety of dialogue options:\n\nTry to comfort the Hyena. Step back to watch what happens. [Melee Attack] Strike while the beast is vulnerable. Leave.\n\nIf you opt to provide comfort to the Hyena, a Baby Gnoll will come out from its insides, leading to a battle against some Gnolls. After you manage to defeat all these enemies, you can search the area where the battle took place and gather items from the bodies of the Gnolls. During this search, you will also come across a letter lying on the ground with the title \"To the Good Godly Folk of Faerun.\" There's another letter to be found on a dead body at the top of the nearby mountain, labeled \"An Open letter on oppression and Peacocks.\" Yet another letter can be discovered just to the right of the first one, titled \"As per my last letter.\" Near this last letter, an important body holds a Quest Item named \"Shipment Orders,\" which activates the quest \"Find the Missing Shipment\" and updates your quest journal.\n\nProceed in the direction of the Northwest until you discover a cave (X:40 Y:626) where Gnolls are attacking survivors from an earlier attack. In this location, you'll encounter various adversaries like Gnoll Hunter, Gnoll Flind, Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu, Gnoll Flesh gnawer, and Hyenas. Once you successfully defeat these enemies, your journal will be updated with advancements in the \"Find the Missing Shipment\" quest. Next, engage in a conversation with one of the survivors named Rugan. Rugan will ask whether any others from his crew have managed to survive, and you can respond with:\n\nNo. It's a grim sight. All I saw was blood and guts.\n\nChoose the first option, and Rugan will explain that their entire expedition through the Risen Roads has been grim. He mentions that this area has become much more dangerous than before and expresses that you are one of the few friendly faces they've encountered since Elturgard. Respond with the following:\n\nElturgard is quite a distance from here. Where are you headed? I'll remain friendly, provided you hand over all your goods.\n\nOpt for the first choice, and Rugan will inform you that they're on their way to Baldur's Gate to deliver cargo, but they need to make a stop en route. Reply with:\n\nWhere's that? Maybe I should accompany you to ensure a safe journey. What exactly are you transporting?\n\nChoose the third option, and Rugan will explain that they are transporting trinkets for someone in Baldur's Gate in exchange for Tarenths. The narrator provides a brief explanation of Tarenths as currency used by the Zhentarim. With this knowledge, respond with:\n\nYou're Zhentarim. Your people deal in more than just 'baubles.' Many people lost their lives for those baubles. [Intimidation] Whatever your cargo is, I'll consider it as payment. I'll leave.\n\nOpt for the first option, and Rugan will be impressed that you recognize their affiliation. He issues a mild warning not to interfere with Zhent business and suggests that you walk away. Respond with:\n\n[Intimidation] No, this is where I stop asking and start cutting. [Persuasion] This is your employer's issue, but we can benefit. Let's sell the cargo ourselves. I'll leave.\n\nIf your charisma is strong enough, you can effectively pick the second choice. Rugan will give you the cargo, but he'll warn that it can't be opened. Warning: doing so will prevent you to get the Harold crossbow. He also mentions that he knows someone in Baldur's Gate who can take the cargo from you. He cautions against trying to deceive him because he has connections all over. Rugan invites you to his hideout and tells his associates to expect your arrival. Your quest journal will then show progress in the \"Find the Shipment\" quest. Now, you have the opportunity to open the chest using Thieves' Tools. If your dexterity is high enough, the chest will open. Inside, you'll find a Potion of Feather Fall and an Iron Flask. Opening the chest will mark the completion of the \"Find the Missing Shipment\" quest. You can also continue to explore the cave, which holds more treasures and chests to discover.\n\nHow to unlock Find the Missing Shipment\n\nAcquired when approaching the gnoll horde at The Risen Road\n\nFind the Missing Shipment Rewards\n\nIf Rugan and Olly died, pick up the chest and leave it unopened. Then when you reach the Zhentarim Hideout you'll have the option ot five it to Zarys to receive gold and the rare crossbow \"Harold\" for your efforts and honesty. If you pick the lock receive gold and an Iron Flask.\n\nFind the Missing Shipment Notes & Tips\n\nAt the Rise Road, you found 2 people trapped inside a cave, surrounded by a horde of gnolls. (Note: you can reach them from another side of the cave, just neet to dodge the boulder and move the barrels.) In order to defeat the gnolls. Place your characters on the nearby high grounds, you can also use the tadpole's psionic power to turn the gnoll warlord against the pack. (And force her to devour herself after the fight) A Mind Flayer Parasite Specimen can be found on Flind, the Gnoll Warlord. If you enter the cave from the other side, you can let caravanners let and fight the gnolls yourself. The men you saved invited you to their hideout. If you lockpick (DC 20) the caravan strongbox, inside would be some gold and the artifact the Iron Flask. Removing the stopper summons a Spectator. DOING THIS WILL LOCK YOU OUT OF FRIENDLY INTERACTIONS WITH THE ZHENTARIM AND POSSIBLY ITS CLIENT (Described as a famous and powerful wizard in Baldur's Gate) The hideout is at Waukeen's Rest, in a wine cellar. To get in there, you need to persuade Salazon, or use the password given by caravaneers. Enter the hideout, and use the wardrobe to find Zarys. If you are instructed to take the shipment to Balder's Gate in Act 3, you may turn it in to Slick Inatra in the Guildhall.\n\nQuests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Devil ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
