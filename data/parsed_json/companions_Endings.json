  "content": "Endings for Baldur's Gate 3 covers all possible conclusions to the game determined by the player's influence on the Forgotten Realms. Each ending is shaped by the key decisions players made throughout the game's Main Quests and Side Quests. How you respond to NPCs during dialogue, how you resolve conflicts in key quests, which Side Quests you choose to pick up and which you don't complete, many choices you make in Baldur's Gate 3 will affect the ending you will get at the end. This page covers each ending for the main story and every character, and the requirements to reach each ending.\n\nHow many endings are there in Baldur's Gate 3?\n\nFrom an interview with one of Larian Studios' lead writers, it was revealed that Baldur's Gate 3 will have 17,000 ending variations on release. That is not to say that there are thousands of unique main story endings, however, given the sheer number of variations there are, it is safe to say that starting a new series of campaigns will lead to a new and fresh experience if you choose to play a different main character.\n\nWith the confirmed count of possible endings, this can guarantee a high level of replayability to discover the multiple ways the game can end. Of course, not all of these endings are major, however, the way you play or interact with the characters in the realm will definitely have an impact on the story of Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nConsider some of the things listed below that can affect Endings in Baldur's Gate:\n\nCharacter Alignment: Was the main character good, evil, or a little more neutral? Character Choices: All the choices that you make throughout a single playthrough WILL have an impact on the story. Character Actions: Your actions and inactions will also affect the story of your current playthrough. Companions: Your party or companions that you choose to travel with will have an impact on the story.\n\nCan I see multiple endings in a single playthrough in BG3?\n\nIt is likely that players will not be able to reach multiple endings in a single playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3. The game's ending will be dictated by many key choices made throughout each story act, and each choice made in earlier acts will influence what choices you have available to you in later acts. Because of this, it is not possible to simply make a save near the end of a playthrough, then go back to said save state to view all the possible unique endings the game has to offer. It will be possible to make saves before or at turning points in the game where you have to make key decisions, though going back and replaying the game each time may prove tedious.\n\nAll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nThis page contains details of scenarios that will lead to specific endings. Extremely detailed spoilers after this point.\n\nThere is a total of 17,000+ endings. The story is affected by the character's nature, actions, and choices. Some endings have a corresponding Trophy that will be unlocked upon achieving that particular ending. Endings have multiple variations that cover the companions, character identity, decisions, and such.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 Main Story Endings\n\nDestroy the Netherbrain and the Tadpoles under its command\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nYou will have two options to choose from when you're facing the Netherbrain, choose \"Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles and itself\" to achieve this ending.\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nThis section is currently a WIP.\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nThis ending is focused on the main character that will become a hero to save the fate of the realms.

Essentially, the good ending is agreeing to Destroy the Elder Brain, regardless of who turns into a Mind Flayer. For the bad ending, either the player convinces the present Mind Flayer to take control of the brain and become the Absolute, or they themself become the Absolute and may involve betraying and killing one of The Emperor, The Prince, or even Karlach.\n\nIf you choose the latter, there will be no companion-specific endings, as they will be all put under your control and become mind-controlled Thralls. This also includes the rest of the world being under your control. Otherwise, if you choose the Elder Brain, your Baldur's Gate 3 Companions can possibly get one of the endings below.\n\nNOTE: This list is still currently being updated as we discover multiple ways the game can play out.\n\nBALDUR'S GATE 3 COMPANION ENDINGS QUICK NAVIGATION\n\nClick to jump to a specific section of the page\n\nAll Astarion Endings in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nHelp Astarion With The Ascension Ritual\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nHelp Astarion with the ritual See the ritual until the end\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nProvide help to Astarion when he asks for it Agree to let all of the spawns die to finish the ritual Choose all the options that will allow the ritual to continue\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nOnce you have defeated Cazador inside his secret room, he will retreat to rest in his sarcophagus. Astarion will open his stone coffin and wake him up from his healing sleep. Astarion will now confront Cazador and the player will be faced with a choice. For this particular ending, we will be helping Astarion with the ritual. Astarion realizes that he can either kill Cazador to be free of him or proceed with the ritual to turn himself into a Vampire Ascendant and become more powerful. Astarion will then ask for your help and give you the following choices:\n\nAll right, what do you need? If I help you complete the ritual, it will kill all these people. Didn't you hear him? If you complete the ritual, you'll be consumed. I'm not doing this.\n\nChoose the first option to help Astarion with the Ascension ritual. Then, Astarion will reveal his plan to put the same curse on Cazador by linking your minds together so he can see the scars that were placed on his back and copy them onto Cazador's body. Halsin will speak up and renounce Astarion's plan, saying that to sacrifice many, the 7,000 spawns, is an abomination. Astarion ignores Halsin and will plead out to you once more, asking for your help.\n\nEnter Astarion's mind so he can proceed with the ritual. No, we can't. I won't help you.\n\nChoose the first option again. Then, Astarion can finally see the marks on his back and will begin to carve out the same mark on Cazador's back as he writhes in pain. The weakened Cazador drops down to his knees before Astarion, as Astarion grabs his staff. Astarion will now begin the Ascension ritual that will consume all of the spawns. During this ritual, Halsin will speak up once more to not let the ritual continue and you will get two choices:\n\nLet the ritual continue. Stop Astarion.\n\nChoose the first one to allow Astarion to finish the ritual, but take note that you will receive Halsin and Shadowheart's disapprovals. As soon as the ritual is over, Astarion exclaims that he is finally free from the hunger, at the cost of 7,000 spawns. Doing this will complete the quest: The Pale Elf, and Astarion will gain new abilities:\n\nAscendant Bite Vampire Ascendant\n\nHelping Astarion with the ritual will also give you a chance to loot Cazador's staff named Woe.\n\nRefuse to Help Astarion With The Ascension Ritual\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nRefuse to help Astarion with the ritual Reject his pleads\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nChoose the dialogue options indicated below.\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nAs Astarion confronts Cazador, he will then ask for your help and give you the following choices:\n\nAll right, what do you need? If I help you complete the ritual, it will kill all these people. Didn't you hear him? If you complete the ritual, you'll be consumed. I'm not doing this.\n\nChoose the fourth one here but Astarion pleads once more and tells you that he can't do it alone. You can reject him again and this will prompt Astarion to go berserk and brutally murder Cazador. He drops to his knees as Cazador turns lifeless. Then, the elf named Dalyria will approach Astarion, asking him if it's truly over. Astarion will tell her that she can do whatever she wants, but the spawns who are in the cages will share the same fate as Astarion. Meaning if he doesn't get freedom, then, they also won't get it.\n\nAstarion will stand up, then grab Cazador's staff and break it into two. Then Astarion will turn to face you, and be resentful for not getting the support that he asked from you. This will result in Astarion permanently leaving your party and the staff will be destroyed, and you won't be able to loot it. (Cazador's Staff: Woe).\n\nAll Shadowheart Endings in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nShadowheart spares the Nightsong and betrays her Lady Shar\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nKeep the Nightsong alive\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nKill Balthazar Spare the Nightsong Choose options that will persuade Shadowheart to let the Nightsong live\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nIn Moonrise Towers, you will discover a power that makes Ketheric Thorm invulnerable. Your party will continue the investigation regarding this power and will lead you to travel to Gauntlet of Shar. At the Verge of the Shadows at (X:-718 Y:-845) you will find a body of water that serves as the entrance to Shadowfell, the domain of Lady Shar. You will get a warning that the state of the region can change depending on your decisions, such as quests becoming unavailable. If you proceed to do so, we recommend following our guide to get the desired outcome. In this case, we will allow Shadowheart to save the Nightsong but betray Lady Shar.\n\nAs you step forward into the statue and through the body of water, you will feel your body struggle as you fight back the sensation. Your character will get knocked out, together with your party. Once you come back to your senses, you will find yourselves in Shadowfell, and Shadowheart immediately recognizes the presence of Lady Shar. However, you will be interrupted as Balthazar flies in to tell you to hurry along and become a witness to his work. Shadowheart defies him and quickly tells him that he does not belong in the Dark Lady's domain.\n\nIn this area, Balthazar has no desire to fight unless you initiate it. He will ask that you follow him as he leads the way into Nightsong's Prison. Your party will be doing a series of jumps until you make it to the bottom of Shadowfell. The pattern shouldn't be difficult and each member is guaranteed to survive the jumps as long as it's near the ledge, and not falling off the rocks. Once you finally catch up with Balthazar, you realize that the relic that Discipe Z'rell was referring to was the Nightsong, which is in fact, a humanoid. She invites you to \"heap more sins upon your head. My retribution will be all the sweeter for them.\" Nightsong continues to reveal, that she supplies Ketheric Thorm's immortality with her own soul. Balthazar calls her \"Aylin\" and commands you to keep back to secure her for a journey.\n\nBalthazar will tell you that she, the Nightsong, possesses immortal strength and lends it to General Throm through his work. After realizing that she is the key to Ketheric Thorm's immortality, you will now have the option to save her or let Balthazar do his job.\n\nIf she's the reason Ketheric Thorm is invulnerable, you're not taking her. Leave, or you're a dead man. Go on, then. Take the Nightsong to Ketheric. Get it over with. Attack him.\n\nIf you choose the first option, Karlach will give you her approval and you will begin to fight Balthazar right after. Take note that this area is surrounded by Balthazar's minions and they will have the advantage as they are in a higher position. Plan well so you can survive this assault. With Balthazar out of the picture, the Nightsong addresses Shadowheart. She possesses the power to free her or kill her. Shadowheart will turn to you and tell you that \"Her fate is mine to seal. Let me handle this.\" but the Nightsong tells her that the only fate she's sealing is her own and that to become a Dark Justiciar, she will know no love, no joy, but only servitude.\n\nShadowheart is conflicted about what she wants to achieve and you will be given the option to help her out:\n\nTrust Shadowheart- do not interfere. Do as you must. Is this truly what you want? Choose your own way, Shadoeheart. You cannot allow your goddess to control you. Please, Shadowheart. Don't do this.\n\nIf you choose the 3rd option, you will sense hesitance in her voice. You will get another chance to talk to her, or sway her with the next choices:\n\nTrust Shadowheart- do not interfere. Do as you must. Choose your own way, Shadoeheart. You cannot allow your goddess to control you. Please, Shadowheart. Don't do this.\n\nChoose the 4th option which will then lead you to the next choices:\n\nAll right. You have my support. This is wrong... but I can't afford to lose you. Do what you must. You want to fight? Fine.\n\nNext, choose the 2nd option so Nightsong will once again, interrupt your conversation with Shadowheart. Nightsong reveals that she knows of the only memory that Shadowheart has. The memory of her being hunted by wolves, and yet, Shadowheart still can't remember what she has lost. Shadowheart still believes that she is meant to become the Lady Justiciar, and you will get the next choices here:\n\nKill her. Let's finish this ritual. [PERSUASION] Don't do it, Shadowheart. Don't kill her, you'll regret it. She knows something about you. Spare her, and see what she has to say. Say nothing.\n\nIf you attempt the Persuasion check, you will need to pass a DC of 21, choosing the 3rd option will also get the same results and grant the approval of Karlach. When successful, she will procure the spear of Lady Shar and grips it tightly as if she's ready for anything that is to come, and yet, she throws away the spear, abandoning her lifelong quest. Shadowheart now fears that she will be disowned, and she fears what will happen next to her. Nightsong tells her that her fate is not fixed and to lay a friendly hand on her, to fight the battle that has been awaiting her, the one that will take your party to Ketheric Thorm, back to Moonrise Towers.\n\nUpon doing so, she calls out to Moonmaiden Selune as power surges through her arm. She declares that the Nightsong is no more, and she transforms into an armored Dame Aylin. She spreads out her wings and swings her mighty sword. She addresses Shadowheart once again and urges that she was able to spurn her Dark Lady, and may start to feel a stirring of the truth after what she has done. Dame Aylin that there is a battle yet to be fought after being freed from her century-long prison. She will now ask Shadowheart, \"Are you ready?\"\n\nReady for what? Dark Lady be merciful... What have I done? To get out of this place? Absolutely. For my weapon? Naturally.\n\nIf you choose the first one, she responds with \"To kill Ketheric Thorm\" and she will fly away to lead the assault in Moonrise Towers against Thorm's army. Shadowheart asks that you leave Shadowfell already after what she has done, and she doesn't want to be in her domain when her rage falls upon her. As you travel through the portal, Shadowheart goes out for a moment. She tells you that she heard Lady Shar's voice after she defied her. She has been abandoned by her goddess and allies. Powerless, she will now seek answers from Dame Aylin.\n\nShadowheart will earn the following rewards:\n\nMoonbeam Selune's Spear of Night Moonlight Glaive\n\nResults and Consequences of Saving the Nightsong\n\nIf you remain supportive of Shadowheart and continue becoming her lover, there is a good chance that you will advance your romance with her. Make sure to check the Companion Approvals page to get her approval. Aside from that, Saving the Nightsong will also result in an easier battle against Ketheric Thorm, but the fight will be taken beneath the Moonrise Towers, to the Mind Flayer Colony. This is where the second and final battle against Ketheric Thorm will take place.\n\nShadowheart Kills the Nightsong and becomes the Dark Justiciar\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nKill Balthazar Kill Nightsong\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nChoose the following dialogue options indicated below to lead Shadowheart into following her Lady Shar\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nWhen Shadowheart confronts the Nightsong, she tells Shadowheart that the only fate she's sealing is her own, that she will know no love, no joy, but only servitude. At this point, you sense Shadowheart's hesitation, and you may be able to sway her from the path of duty to the path of light. If you want the outcome of Shadowheart becoming Lady Justiciar, choose the second one.\n\nTrust Shadowheart- do not interfere. Do as you must. Is this truly what you want? Choose your own way, Shadoeheart. You cannot allow your goddess to control you. Please, Shadowheart. Don't do this.\n\nThen your next choice should be the first one. However, if you choose the first one, Karlach will give you her disapproval, while Astarion will give his approval.\n\nKill her. Let's finish this ritual. [PERSUASION] Don't do it, Shadowheart. Don't kill her, you'll regret it. She knows something about you. Spare her, and see what she has to say. Say nothing.\n\nShadowheart summons the Spear of Lady Shar and pierces Nightsong with it. Nightsong tells her that she is Shar's child after all as she feels true death, at last. Shortly after, Shadowheart will hear the voice of her goddess, Lady Shar. She calls out to her as her Chosen, her Warrior, and her Dark Justiciar. After this, Shadowheart will receive rewards from her. Lady Shar speaks of attacking Ketheric Thorm after he shunned her embrace and using her domain to house the Nightsong. If you follow this guide, killing Nightsong will complete the 'Find the Nightsong' quest.\n\nShadowheart will receive the following rewards:\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets Dark Justiciar Half-Plate Dark Justiciar Mail Dark Justiciar Boots Shar's Spear of Evening\n\nResults and Consequences of Killing the Nightsong\n\nAs Shadowheart embraces the will of Lady Shar and becomes Shar's chosen, she will tell you that there will be no room for love now that she has become the Dark Justiciar. This will throw out any chances of romancing Shadowheart. Additionally, the following events will take place:\n\nThe Selunite Cleric named Isobel will perish during the battle, and the Last Light Inn will get attacked Jaheira will die in battle Dammon will die, preventing the player from earning Infernal Iron that can be used in Karlach's romance and personal quest Art Cullagh will also die, preventing you from recruiting Halsin and the famed bear-form romance.\n\nAll Gale Endings in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nGale Destroys the Elder Brain\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nTravel to Mind Flayer Colony Tell Gale to: \"Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.\"\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nChoose the dialogue options below.\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nThis is a character ending that is specific to one of your companions, Gale. He has a shared and deep history with Mystra, the Goddess that he once served. You and your party will arrive at the foot of the Mind Flayer Colony and will see 3 mortals Orin, Ketheric Thorm, and Lord Enver Gortash, who has successfully enslaved an Elder Brain.\n\nUpon seeing this, Gale is in awe of the power in front of him, and how he wishes to hold it. However, he stops himself and tells him that he can't and must obey as his goddess commands. You, as the main character will hear this and will be prompted with two options:\n\nGale, you cannot do this. You can't condemn us to death. Go ahead. We stand no chance against such forces. Let's end this together.\n\nIf you choose the second option, he will then respond to you, \"One last gale to end them all\". Gale unleashes the bomb within him, the one that he's been keeping in check ever since your journey together began. The smoke begins to rise up from beneath the Moonrise Towers where the elder brain was destroyed. However, the tadpoles, without the control of The Absolute, they will now consume the minds of their host and complete their transformations.\n\nSoon, Illithids will plague the lands and enslave all those they do not infect. The narrator continues, \"It is an ending of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you.\"\n\nGale Sacrifices Himself to Destroy the Elder Brain (Act 3)\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nGale must climb atop alone.\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nWhen Gale tells you \"I'm ready. Are you?\" Reply to him with the second option: \"Wait. We could end this now if you unleashed the orb.\" Then, choose the Persuasion check and pass the DC of 30: \"We did, but look at the devastation around us. You need to end this now.\"\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nBefore the final battle against The Elder Brain, you can persuade Gale to sacrifice himself by detonating the Netherese bomb that he has been keeping in check during your travels. You will bid farewell to Gale, and he will begin to cast a spell that seems to have transported you and the rest of the party before he climbs up the tower-like structure.\n\nThe cutscene will show Gale climbing by himself as the Nautiloid Ship flies by. The Netherbrain can be heard offering Gale to surrender and live as a thrall as Gale walks to the panel. Gale greets the Netherbrain and bids his own farewell right as he conjures a sword with his magic. Without any hesitation, Gale stabs himself right in the middle of his chest and successfully detonates the Netherese Orb.\n\nWith one heroic act, Gale has successfully stopped the attack on Baldur's Gate killing all the Mind Flayers together with the Netherbrain. Later on, the townsfolk can be seen rejoicing and the rest of your party will commend Gale for his heroic act.\n\nGale Tries to Become a God\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nPlay as Gale Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nChoose the good-natured ending Let the cutscenes play out in the end\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nIn this ending, Gale realizes that his journey is far from over after successfully defeating the Netherbrain. Knowing that The Crown is in the depths of the Chionthar, Gale will seek to salvage the stones and reforge the Crown, to claim the power of Netheril at last. Once The Crown has been restored, Gale ponders at the thought of returning it to Mystra so the world will be rid of its temptation, or Gale will control it for himself, and become a god.\n\nHowever, this ending will also result in Karlach dying (if she hasn't died in the final battle) before Gale can pursue his ending. Shortly after, the cutscene will begin with a cosmic view where Gale is reunited with his goddess. Mystra commends you for inheriting the powers of Karsus' powers. She will ask you of your plans with them. You will get the following choices:\n\nI came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all. I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition. I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.\n\nChoose the second option here, but this will anger Mystra and will result in a fight against her. Mystra tells Gale that he should have remained mortal. In the end, Gale will die as a result of this battle.\n\nGale offers The Crown and The Karsite Weave to Mystra\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nGale Origin Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nChoose the good-natured ending Let the cutscenes play out in the end Choose the dialogue options below\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nSimilar to the previous ending, the only difference here is choosing another option from the ones shown during your conversation with Mystra.\n\nI came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all. I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition. I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.\n\nIf you choose to surrender everything, Mystra will commend you for your service and you will get the next choices:\n\nI only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again. I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down. I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again.\n\nIf you choose the 3rd one, Mystra will tell you to be patient and will leave you once again.\n\nGale becomes Illithid\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nPlay as Gale Origin Command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nChoose the good-natured ending Let the cutscenes play out in the end Choose the dialogue options below\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nThis is similar to the good-natured ending where you choose to command the Netherbrain to destroy the tadpoles under its command, and then itself. By playing Gale's origin, you will get this cutscene in the finale where you will seek Mystra. She will still commend you for becoming the inheritor of Karsus' powers and ask what are your plans with them.\n\nI came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave- take it all. I will become a new kind of god. One with ambition. I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the weave.\n\nMake sure to choose the first one so Mystra will show compassion with your transformation as an Illithid. She tells you that she has the power to restore your life and soul if you are willing to leave the mortal realms and return with her, to Elysium. You will get the following choices:\n\nPerhaps one day, but for now, there's more I need to accomplish./ Being an Illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am. I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.\n\nChoose the 3rd option here, and Mystra will accept you once more. This will result in Mystra making you her Chosen, once more.\n\nAll Karlach Endings in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nKarlach becomes the Mind Flayer that kills the Netherbrain and Survives\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nFree Orpheus Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nFree Orpheus Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nThere is another known variation of how you can spare yourself from becoming a Mind Flayer, and allow Karlach to undergo Ceremorphosis, instead of you or Orpheus. This can happen with the help of Orpheus, but first, you need to free him. When the Emperor asks you to release the Netherstones to him and you choose to reject him there, he will leave the area.\n\nThen, you can proceed to help the Prince. Once the Prince is freed, he tells you about how the Netherbrain is so strong that it will require an Illithid to unleash the full potential of the Netherstones. You will be given the following choices listed below:\n\nSomeone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that? There has to be another way. I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer. I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it. This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.\n\nChoosing the third option here will prompt Karlach to speak up and say that maybe you (the player) don't have to and that it should be her. Then, you will get the next choices:\n\nWhy you? This isn't your sacrifice to make. Better you than me.\n\nChoose the first option here and Karlach will reveal that she is dying. She continues that her heart feels like a live grenade and that she could explode any minute. She goes on to tell you that you have a life to live, and she doesn't. She also wants to be the one to save the world, if there's no other way for her to go. Then, you will get the next choices:\n\nIf this is what you really want, all I can say is thank you. No, Karlach. This is for me to do. I'll embrace the parasite- I'll evolve. No, neither of us is turning into a Mind Flayer. Not now.\n\nChoose the first one once more, and Karlach will express her willingness to do it. Then, Orpheus will commend Karlach for her sacrifice and bravery. Shortly after, Orpheus will withdraw his power for a moment and this will turn her into a Mind flayer that will eventually help you to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. After her transformation, Orpheus reactivates his power once more and shields her from the Netherbrain once more.\n\nOrpheus kneels before Karlach who has completely changed, and tells her: \"My people will remember you, tiefling.\" despite her being fully transformed into a Mind Flayer. Orpheus goes on to return to the city, follow the path of the Netherbrain, and stop the attack. Before you progress, Karlach will begin to say that she is still herself, but more. She tells you that her gear is now silent and no longer threatening to explode.\n\nNext, you will seek the Netherbrain and fight the final battle. This will lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself. A good-natured ending is to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and then itself. This ending will successfully destroy the Netherbrain and the tadpoles under its command, and the fighting below in the city will cease. The people of different races will rejoice as they are freed from the grips and terror of the Illithid Empire. Later on, you and your party will gather in the city to celebrate your win against the Illithids. Orpheus commends Karlach once more and assures her that all Githyanki will know her name and her sacrifice.\n\nKarlach becomes the Mind Flayer and You Betray Her (The Dark Urge)\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nFree Orpheus Entrust the Netherstones to Orpheus Betray Karlach during the final battle Must have The Dark Urge origin\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nFree Orpheus Reject the offer of The Emperor to work together Choose the dialogue options below that will prompt Karlach to do it instead of you As Karlach resists the Netherbrain's temptation, attack her Claim the throne in Bhaal's name\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nThis is an alternate version of Karlach's first ending. Just as the Absolute has weakened, Karlach will approach you and say \"This is it soldier. This is what we fought for. Time to end this thing.\" Karlach is fighting it off with all her strength, and you see this as an opportunity to betray him. Just as the absolute tempts Karlach, you remember the destiny promised by your Father. You become enslaved, dominated, and ruined. You feel the need to seize your rightful claim to the brain and not destroy it. You see this as a way to escape the horrors of Bhaal's anguish, so you decide to Claim the Absolute in the name of Bhaal. Betray Karlach.\n\nJust as you launch to attack Karlach, she exclaims that this is all she has, but you have made up your mind and will brutally attack her. Then, Wyll expresses his disbelief as he witnesses your act. This is a bad-natured ending where you will rule the world and betray your companions.\n\nAll Lae'zel Endings in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nOrpheus becomes the Mind Flayer, then asks to be killed, and Lae'zel Leaves\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nReject the Emperor's offer to work together Free Orpheus Agree to Orpheus becoming the Mind Flayer\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nChoose the dialogue options below\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nIn this ending, you will break your alliance with The Emperor and you will choose to free The Prince of Githyanki. This will result to Lae'zel being happy with your decision to work with the Githyanki, instead of the Netherbrain. He will reveal that The Emperor was telling the truth about needing a sacrifice to put a stop to the plan of the Netherbrain. You will be given the following choices listed below:\n\nSomeone will need to turn into a mind flayer. Are you willing to do that? There has to be another way. I'm not becoming a Mind Flayer. I understand. If that's what it takes, I'll do it. This isn't an easy decision. I need a moment to consider it.\n\nChoose the first one here and the Emperor will lament that he has just been freed and yet he will be subjected to Ceremorphosis. He agrees to the sacrifice and he plans to end the Grand Design by becoming an Illithid. At this moment, Lae'zel will speak up and tell him that he must not do it. Now, the player will get two choices:\n\nYou are a true hero. Keep your soul- your people need you. I will make the sacrifice.\n\nChoosing the first option here will turn Orpheus into a Mind flayer that will anger the rest of the Githyanki who believe in the Prince, but Orpheus will address Voss, and speak to him as the true heir. Lae'zel will take The Prince's side, who has now transformed into an Illithid. Now, the Githyanki will swear their allegiance to you, as commanded by Orpheus. With everyone's help, you will be able to defeat the Illithids and end the Grand Design. This ending will also lead to you choosing to command the brain to destroy the tadpoles and itself.\n\nLater on, your party will gather below in the city. Orpheus dreams of his people being liberated, but he doesn't want to return to them as an Illithid. He will now ask to be destroyed by you, and then he will address Lae'zel to make a promise before him. He will pass on his hope and burdens to her, in the hopes to release their people.\n\nThen, you will get the following options:\n\nYou should do this, Lae'zel. Your people need you. [PERSUASION] You have found a new purpose here, Lae'zel. Stay in Faerun, and craft a new fate.\n\nIf you choose the first one, Lae'zel will agree willingly to Orpheus' wishes. Now Orpheus will seek his freedom and you will get another set of choices:\n\nYou don't deserve to die. You're a mind flayer, but you're still you, aren't you? Kill him. Give him the honorable death he craves.\n\nAgree to kill him here, and Lae'zel will now take charge to save the Githyanki from Vlaakith.\n\nAll Wyll Endings in Baldur's Gate 3\n\nWyll Breaks the Contract and Becomes a Human Again\n\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nSet for camp to trigger the conversation with Mizora\n\nHow to Obtain Ending:\n\nEncourage will to break the contract Keep Wyll alive until the very end\n\nENDING DESCRIPTION\n\nIt turns out that Mizora hasn't been forthcoming with her pact with Wyll. During Wyll's Pact cutscene, Mizora summons the Sisters of Justice- the adjudicators of diabolical contracts and bargains. Mizora reveals that she has come to bargain, and the Hells demand witness. Will is impatient and asks where is his father (The Duke of Ravengard) and how can he save him. Mizora then responds that the way is to bargain.\n\nMizora then proceeds to show Wyll's contract and says that it is unbreakable. She goes on to tell you that she wants a life for a life. If Wyll wants to end the contract, then a sacrifice must be made. She offers Wyll two choices:\n\nShe will reveal his father's location but he will pledge his life and soul to her and Archdevil Zariel, in an eternal pact. She will break Wyll's contract and he will be free, but his father will die.\n\nIf you have Karlach in your party, she will speak up in retaliation but Mizora silences her. Now, you will get the following options:\n\nWhat will happen to Wyll's powers if he breaks the pact? Save your father, Wyll. The city will need him to help rebuild. Do the right thing. Give your soul so that your father can live. Break the pact. Wyll. You deserve your freedom. Let your father die. When the city is free, you can take his place.\n\nChoose the fourth one and Wyll will tell Mizora to break the pact. The contract burns right before your eyes and Mizora will tell you that she will stick around for 'the entertainment'. Despite what Mizora had told you, it turns out that Grand Duke Ravengard can still be saved. The only difference is that it will be more difficult to locate him but you can refer to this page for info: Rescue the Grand Duke. Additionally, Wyll will still be able to use his Warlock powers right until you defeat The Absolute in the final battle.\n\nNow that Wyll is a free man, he will be able to transform back into his original form later on in the final cutscene.",
