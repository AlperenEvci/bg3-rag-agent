The Eldritch Knight gains spells known at different levels either from the EK spell list (Evo and Abj spells only) at levels 3, 4, 7,10,11 and the Wizard (Expanded; Any spell school) spell list at levels 3 and 8. You can't learn spells from scrolls, but you can use the scrolls to cast spells to maximize Eldritch Strike. Bound weapon with thrown property + tavern brawler + dueling fighting style can help you deal a lot of damage. You may also equip the Ring of Flinging for +1d4 extra damage. To get the most out of this subclass, dip at least 1 level in Wizard. This will give you eventual access to level 3 spell slots(earliest at EK 3 Wizard 4), as well as ritual casting without using a feat and Arcane Recovery. And while depending on your level mix you may not be able to learn third level spells by natural progression, your Wizard level(s) will allow you to scribe them into your spellbook from scrolls. Multiclassing an Eldritch Knight with a Barbarian is viable. You will be able to cast spells such as Enhanced Leap before entering Rage and retain it. The Barbarian rage only breaks concentration, so the Enhanced Leap will remain active for the entire duration. From the Comments Section a build was suggested, named: The Immortal Eldritch Bonk: Get Tavern Brawler to add twice the Strength to your throwsGet Shattered Flail and bond with it so it will come back to your hand once thrown (This way you can hit an enemy every turn by simply throwing and you get an awesome heal too )Get dueling fighting style to add + 2 damageGet Caustic Band Ring ( Myconid colony trader ) + 2 acid damage with weapon attacksGet Ring of Flinging ( Emerald Grove Trader ) + 1d4 for throwing damage Simply throw the mace on the attack, then do awesome damage and heal yourself from the mace effect.
