Deal with the Devil can be acquired during Act 3. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earning more loot and experience to become more powerful.\n\nDeal with the Devil Objectives\n\nSpeak with Raphael\n\nWe found Raphel's servant Korrile on the ground floor of Sharess' Caress. She told us her master awaits us on the top floor.\n\nDeal with the Devil Walkthrough\n\nIn Sharess' Caress, proceed to another room on the 2nd floor at X:-14 Y:105 and engage a conversation with Raphael. He's pleased to see you and snaps his fingers to clear your mind. Initiate a conversation using the following responses:\n\nDid you just rid me of the tadpole with a snap of your fingers? I feel... empty. What did you do? Another mere trick. Show me something substantial.\n\nChoose the first option, and Raphael clarifies that your tadpole remains, but he has silenced your other guest temporarily for a private discussion. The Illithid cannot eavesdrop. Your companions raise concerns, questioning Raphael's intentions. Respond with:\n\nI trust the Illithid more than I trust you. Speak freely then - tell me why I'm here. Clever, but you initially promised a cure, not this.\n\nOpt for the second option, and Raphael affirms his commitment to his word, asserting that he'll eliminate your tadpole. He acknowledges your progress and your pursuit of confronting the elder brain. He hints that you possess the means to destroy it. Inquire:\n\nThe Astral Prism? The Emperor? Orpheus?\n\nSelect the third option, and Raphael confirms your suspicion. He explains that he can offer a solution to set Orpheus free. Respond with:\n\nContinue. Orpheus' guards tried to kill me - he's dangerous. Why would I want to free him?\n\nOpt for the third option, and Raphael sarcastically wonders if you prefer indulging in the Emperor's tentacles. He elaborates that Orpheus could ally with you against the elder brain, since you share an enmity with it. Express your thoughts:\n\nBased on what I've seen, Orpheus is my adversary, and the Emperor is my ally. The Emperor is the reason I'm alive. Fine - explain how I can free him.\n\nChoose the first option, and Raphael attempts to convince you of your gullibility. He asserts that you're merely a tool for the Emperor's agenda, transporting it to the elder brain. While Orpheus might cooperate initially, if he resists, you might have to eliminate him. Reply:\n\nThe risk is worth taking. How can I free Orpheus? I'm convinced. Tell me the method to liberate Orpheus. We're done here - I'm departing.\n\nOpt for the first option, resulting in two updated quests \"Free Orpheus\" and 'Deal with the Devil\" in your journal. Raphael discloses that the Orphic Hammer is an artifact capable of breaking Prince Orpheus' chains, secured at the House of Hope. Respond with:\n\nPerfect - hand it over. Seems too convenient to be true. How convenient that you possess exactly what I need.\n\nSelect the third option, and Raphael suggests the convenience could extend to your offering something in return. Reply:\n\nWhat's your desired gain from all this? You probably want my soul for the Hammer, right? Just reveal your demands. I won't negotiate with you, Raphael.\n\nChoose the second option, and Raphael discloses that he desires something more valuable: the Crown that controls the Elder Brain. Respond with:\n\nI'm intrigued - explain your eagerness for the crown. What exactly is this crown? Handing over such a potent artifact to a devil seems risky. No.\n\nOpt for the first option, and he speaks of power, tracing his longing for the Crown back to when Archwizard Karsus created it, leading to the fall of the Netheril empire. Raphael was present at its demise. He explains that anyone who possesses it can ascend to godhood. His goal is to rule the Nine Hells with its power. This advances the \"The Wizard of Waterdeep\" quest. Reply with:\n\nThe thought of you ruling the Nine Hells isn't comforting. You'd make an excellent Archdevil Supreme. How can you be confident in using the Crown where Karsus failed? Why didn't you seize the crown earlier? I'll take the crown and wield its power myself.\n\nChoose the third option, and Raphael states his immortal nature prevents failure. Reply with:\n\nIf you're incapable of failing, why couldn't you obtain the Crown before? The notion of you ruling the Nine Hells isn't reassuring.\n\nOpt for the first option, and he explains that Mephistopheles, one of the Archdevils, sealed the Crown in one of his vaults. Raphael awaited an opportunity, and when the Chosen's actions brought the crown into play, he seized the chance. Reply:\n\nIt must irk you that mortals managed to steal the crown while you couldn't. How did the crown end up with them? How can you be certain I'll secure the crown?\n\nChoose the first option, and Raphael agrees, frustrated by the mess they caused. He outlines the deal: when you vanquish the Elder Brain, bring the Crown to him, and he'll exchange it for the hammer. Choose:\n\nI accept the terms. Where do I sign? I'd rather destroy the crown than risk its misuse again. Once I possess the Netherstones, I'll control the Crown myself. No deal, Raphael - I'm leaving.\n\nSelect the fourth option and depart.\n\nYou don't need to accept Raphael's offer to free Orpheus. Simply sneaking into House of Hope and steal the hammer will do (Free Orpheus). If you regret signing a contract with the devil, you can steal your contract as well.\n\nHow to unlock Deal with the Devil\n\nDeal with the Devil Rewards\n\nDeal with the Devil Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & tips go here\n\nAll Quests in Baldur's Gate 3 Acquire the Gauntlets for Helsik ♦ Aid the Underduke ♦ Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help ♦ Avenge Glut's Circle ♦ Avenge the Drowned ♦ Avenge the Hag Survivors ♦ Avenge the Ironhands ♦ Blind the Absolute ♦ Break Yurgi's Contract ♦ Break Yurgir's Contract ♦ Call of the Blood ♦ Capture Isobel the Selunite Cleric ♦ Confront the Elder Brain ♦ Consider Gortash's Bargain ♦ Control the Elder Brain ♦ Cure the Poisoned Gnome ♦ Deal with the Gnomes ♦ Defeat Ketheric Thorm ♦ Defeat Mystic Carrion ♦ Defeat the Duergar Intruders ♦ Defeat the Goblins ♦ Deliver Nere's Head ♦ Destroy the Ancient Tome ♦ Destroy the Elder Brain ♦ Disable the Steel Watch ♦ Discover the Artefact's Secrets ♦ Discover the History of Prince Orpheus ♦ Embrace Your Potential ♦ Escape the Deal ♦ Escape the Nautiloid ♦ Explore the ruins ♦ Feed the Mind Flayer ♦ Find a Cure ♦ Find a way into Wyrm's Rock fortress ♦ Find Arabella's Parents ♦ Find Doni ♦ Find Dribbles the Clown ♦ Find Explosives ♦ Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic ♦ Find Mol ♦ Find Mystic Carrion's Servant ♦ Find Rolan in the Shadows ♦ Find the 'Stern Librarian' Ffion ♦ Find the Blood of Lathander ♦ Find the Githyanki Creche ♦ Find The Missing Boots ♦ Find the Missing Letters ♦ Find the Missing Shipment ♦ Find the Mushroom Picker ♦ Find the Nightsong ♦ Find your belongings ♦ Find Zevlor ♦ Finish the Masterwork weapon ♦ Follow the Convoy ♦ Forging a Heart ♦ Free Counsellor Florrick ♦ Free Lae'zel ♦ Free Orpheus ♦ Free the artist ♦ Free True Soul Nere ♦ Fulfill the Deal ♦ Gather Your Allies ♦ Get Gortash's Netherstone ♦ Get Help from Auntie Ethel ♦ Get Help from Healer Nettie ♦ Get Orin's Netherstone ♦ Get Past the Rubble ♦ Help Kith'rak Voss ♦ Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite ♦ Help the Cursed Monk ♦ Help the Devilish Ox ♦ Help the Hag Survivors ♦ Help Your Protector ♦ Hunt the Devil ♦ Impress the Murder Tribunal ♦ Infiltrate Moonrise Towers ♦ Investigate Cazador's Palace ♦ Investigate Kagha ♦ Investigate the Beach ♦ Investigate the House of Grief ♦ Investigate the Murders ♦ Investigate the Selunite Resistance ♦ Investigate the Suspicious Toys ♦ Kill Kagha ♦ Kill Raphael's Old Enemy ♦ Lift the Shadow Curse ♦ Open your Scars ♦ Protect the Myconid Circle ♦ Punish the Wicked ♦ Raid the Emerald Grove ♦ Raid the Grove ♦ Remove the Parasite ♦ Rescue Orin's Victim ♦ Rescue the Druid Halsin ♦ Rescue the gnome ♦ Rescue the Gnomes in Moonrise Towers ♦ Rescue the Grand Duke ♦ Rescue the Illithid's Captive ♦ Rescue the survivors ♦ Rescue the Tieflings ♦ Rescue the Trapped Man ♦ Rescue Volo ♦ Rescue Wulbren ♦ Resolve the Abduction ♦ Retrieve Omeluum ♦ Return Rakath's Gold ♦ Return the Locket ♦ Roveer's Storehouse ♦ Save Arabella ♦ Save Hope ♦ Save Mayrina ♦ Save the First Druid ♦ Save the Goblin Sazza ♦ Save the Gondians ♦ Save the Grymforge Gnomes ♦ Save the refugees ♦ Save Vanra ♦ Search the Cellar ♦ Seek Protection from the Shadow Curse ♦ Servant of None ♦ Soft-Step Trial ♦ Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders ♦ Steal a Githyanki Egg ♦ Steal the Sacred Idol ♦ Stop the Presses ♦ Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia ♦ Talk to the Sentient Amulet ♦ The Adamantine Forge ♦ The Dark Cleric ♦ The Knights of Shield ♦ The Ritual ♦ Travel through the Mountain Pass ♦ Travel through the Underdark ♦ Travel to Moonrise Towers ♦ Unlock the Ancient Tome ♦ Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout ♦ Wake up Art Cullagh",
