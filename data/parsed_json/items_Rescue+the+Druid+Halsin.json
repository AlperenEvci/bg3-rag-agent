You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nwhat the hells are you doing? He's helpless. Let him go. Sharper stones might cut through all that fur. Turn away.\n\nChoosing dialogue 1 will have the goblins explain what the bear did to them, and wanting to torture it more. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nGo on, then. Keep at it. Leave him alone! How about a taste of your own medicine? [ILLITHID][WISDOM] Let him out. I'll take care of the beast.\n\nChoosing dialogue 3 will have the bear break open the cage doors and commence battle. You will have to pass the Wisdom skill check with a DC of 2 if you chose dialogue 4, if succeeded, they will listen to you and open the cage. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nAttack the goblins. Charge the bear. Leave the bear to the goblins' mercy.\n\nChoosing dialogues 1 or 2 will commence in a battle against the goblins. Halsin will turn back to normal and speak with you. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nGlad I could be of help. You're Halsin? The Master Halsin of the emerald Grove? I spoke to Nettie - she said you could help me with the parasite in my head. I've heard you're an unmatched healer. I need your help. I've been to the emerald Grove. It's in danger. You should get out of here. It's not safe.\n\nChoosing dialogue 2 will have Halsin tell you to just call him by his name. You will have the same dialogues to choose from. Choosing dialogue 5 will reveal that Halsin is aware of the situation at the Emerald Grove, he notices the look on your face and examines you, making him aware of your parasite. He asks you about it. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nI don't know I escaped from an illithid ship after being infected. Maybe the process was interrupted. I think this artefact has something to do with it.\n\nChoosing dialogue 2 will make Halsin realize you were looking for him to cure you, and tells you that he has been studying them. He cannot cure you, but he will try to help. He has found out the origin location of these enchantments that has been placed on the tadpoles. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nTell me what you've learned about the tadpoles' origins. This magic isn't typical of how mind flayers procreate? So all of this was for nothing. You learned all this from your studies?\n\nChoosing dialogue 1 will have Halsin talk about the information he knows about the tadpoles. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nYou seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise? Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best. At least I know what to do now. Thank you.\n\nChoosing dialogue 2 will reveal that Halsin is certain of the information he knows about the cure being at Moonrise Towers. He asks you for help and in return will accompany you on your journey to the Moonrise Towers. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nAll right. How do I help? Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos. Kagha carried out the Rite of Thorns - the grove has been sealed off from the world.\n\nChoosing dialogue 1 will have Halsin tell you his plans and what he needs help with. Which is to defeat the goblin leaders. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nHaving a shapeshifting bear-druid at my side might make things easier. I'll deal with this. You get to safety. The grove isn't my problem. I have to concentrate on saving myself. You ask too much of me. I can't help you.\n\nChoosing dialogue 2 will gain the approval of Gale and Shadowheart, but the disapproval of Astarion. Halsin will refuse to leave unless the grove is secure. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nFollow me, then. Your bear form may prove useful. All right. Wait here until it's done.\n\nChoosing dialogue 1 will have Halsin inform you of the precautions you will have to make if he changes into his bear form. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nCome with me. Stay here.\n\nChoosing dialogue 2 will have Halsin stay back and wishing you luck.\n\nDefeating the Goblin Leaders\n\nMinthara can be found in a room a floor above where you can find the Priestess Gut, take the stairs behind her and head right. Follow the path and you will find her by a table (X:327 Y:40) Interacting with her will start a conversation with her, she is aware you carry the parasite. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nI'm on a hunt of my own. I'm looking for a druid named Halsin. A hunt? Who's the target? I have my own business to take care of. How do you know I'm a True Soul? I'm on a hunt, too - you're my prey.\n\nChoosing dialogue 5 will commence battle with Minthara. Choosing dialogue 2 and Minthara will say that people who worship a false god are her targets and that shes aware there is a weapon of the absolute, which is the artefact you carry. Minthara talks about Halsin. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nThe tieflings should be warned. Together, you can outnumber her warband. Leading her to the tieflings might doom them... But it would earn you her trust. Perhaps you can misdirect her... or kill her.\n\nChoosing dialogue 2 will have Minthara eager to start the hunt. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nI can be very persuasive - I'll visit the prisoner. We don't need the prisoner. I already know the place you're looking for. My hunt ends here - you're my prey. Leave.\n\nChoosing dialogue 2 will make Minthara skeptical. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nNothing stays hidden from me. The Absolute guided me.\n\nChoosing dialogue 1 will make Minthara enter your mind so you can show it to her. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nGet out of my mind. Allow her to read your thoughts. [INTELLIGENCE] Obscure memories of the grove with images of half-remembered places.\n\nChoosing dialogue 2 will make Minthara trust you and tell her plans of what you should do. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nI prefer to face my enemies rather tahn stabbing them in the back And once I'm inside? [LOLTH-DWORN] I don't have the most trustworthy face.\n\nChoosing dialogue 2 will reveal Minthara's plan in the Grove, and speaks about the Absolute. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nI've done enough. The battle is yours to fight. It shall be so. No. This ends now, and so do you.\n\nChoosing dialogue 2 will gain the approval of Astarion, and the disapproval of Gale. Monthara will also be pleased with you. Minthara trusts you and ends the conversation. She will walk onto the wooden bridge, you can break the bridge and killing her when she falls.\n\nThe priestess Gut can be found in the main room in the Shattered Sanctum (X:302 Y:-12). Interacting with Priestess Gut will start the subquest Ask the Goblin Priestess for Help. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nWhy should I let you brand me? I assume this mark has a purpose. I'm not letting you burn me for life on a whim. I'm here to spill your guts across the floor.\n\nChoosing dialogue 4 will gain the approval of Astarion but the disapproval of Shadowheart. This will commence battle between your party and the goblins.\n\nDror Ragzlin can be found at the far North in the Shattered Sanctum (X:294 Y:35). The easiest way to defeat him is to use Shadowheart, drink an invisibility potion and shove him down towards the hole on the upper right corner. Otherwise, entering the room will commence a battle immediately.\n\nDefend the Grove from the Goblin Attack\n\nYou can report to Halsin that you have defeated all the leaders or that they have gone to the grove. Head to the grove together. If Minthara is still alive, you can meet her at the Grove (X:219 Y:422) and fight her there.\n\nMeet Halsin in the Emerald Grove\n\nHalsin can be found at the Emerald Grove at The Hollow by the Sacred Pool (X:265 Y:533) speaking with Kagha. Interact with him to hear that Halsin is upset with Kagha. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nThat's all? She tried to imprison a child. You'll have your hands full with her. She shows great spirit, to put it mildly. No need to be so harsh. Kagha acted out of concern. The fire of ambition is in her very blood - and cruel blood is a life companion. You were too lenient. There's bad blood between tieflings and druids because of her.\n\nChoosing dialogue 1 will have Halsin explain why he chose such punishment. He thanks you, and asks you to speak to Rath regarding your reward. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nI hope this grove of yours was worth the bloodshed. What happens next? Leave.\n\nChoosing dialogue 1 will have Halsin tell you how important the grove is to him. This will give you the same dialogue options. Leave and explore the grove.\n\nYou can find Zevlor on a stone bridge in Emerald Grove (X:212 Y:458) Speak to him, he will tell you that he is ready to leave.

We'll see you there.\n\nLearn more about Halsin\n\nChoosing either dialogue will end the day and everyone will be at the campsite. After the celebration, Halsin will speak to you regarding your journey together to Moonrise Tower. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nWhat's so dangerous about it? Moonrise Tower it is them. I'd better make haste. I was expecting more from you than a lead towards some distant, dangerous prospect. That's it? Just go to this place?\n\nChoosing dialogue 4 will shock Halsin seeing that you expected more. He goes on to say how dangerous this place is. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nSounds like I've no choice - I need to find a way through. What do you suggest? The Absolute's forces can tolerate such a place? There must be another way to cure myself. How are you so sure Moonrise is where I have to go?\n\nChoosing dialogue 2 will have Halsin suggest to go through Risen Road or through the Underdark to Moonrise Towers. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nI found the hidden entrance in the temple of Selûne - the way is clear. I don't want to risk getting lost in the Underdark - I'll journey overland. I never thought I'd say this, but it sounds like the Underdark is the safer route. What would you do?\n\nChoosing dialogue 1 shocks Halsin and he wishes you join your camp and go to Moonrise Towers with you. You will have the following dialogue options.\n\nLet's go, then. You want to come to Moonrise as well? Why? What about the grove?\n\nChoosing dialogue 1 puts Halsin in your camp, and this ends the conversation and completes Rescue the Druid Halsin.\n\nRescue the Druid Halsin Objectives\n\nFind the druid Halsin\n\nHalsin was last seen leaving the grove with a group of adventurers.
