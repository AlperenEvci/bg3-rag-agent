 <h2 class="titlearea">Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 8</h2> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Release Date: April 15, 2025</li> 
  <li>Platforms: All platforms</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <h4>Steam Trading Cards</h4> 
 <p>Baldur’s Gate 3 now supports Steam Trading Cards! And you thought you’d never get them.</p> 
 <p>Collect the unique trading cards to craft badges, and unlock exclusive profile backgrounds and emoticons to use anywhere on Steam!</p> 
 <h4>Cross-Play</h4> 
 <p>Players on PC, Mac, Xbox, and PlayStation 5 will now all be able to enjoy Baldur’s Gate 3 multiplayer, with full cross-platform progression and cross-play.</p> 
 <p>Using the Larian Network, you can now join and create cross-play lobbies to take on your adventures together.</p> 
 <h4>Cross-Play &amp; Mods</h4> 
 <p>You’ll be able to continue to enjoy creating chaos with mods in cross-play, but it’s important to note that all players joining the lobby must have the same version of mods installed. When joining a host’s game, you’ll be prompted with the Mod Verification window to enable, upgrade, downgrade, or install any missing mods.</p> 
 <p>If you are a PC player creating a cross-play lobby, keep in mind you can use the “Available on Console &amp; Mac” tag to browse mods that will be compatible with consoles and Mac, and that the mod limit on consoles is 100. Third-party mods cannot be used on consoles.&nbsp;</p> 
 <h4>Using Cross-Play</h4> 
 <p>How to join another player in multiplayer via cross-play:</p> 
 <ol> 
  <li>On the main menu, select “Multiplayer”.</li> 
  <li>Select the “Cross-Play” tab.</li> 
  <li>Join the other player’s lobby.</li> 
  <li>If you or the host are using mods and there are any discrepancies, the Mod Verification window will open to inform you of which mods need installing, uninstalling, or updating.</li> 
 </ol> 
 <p>How to create a cross-play multiplayer lobby:</p> 
 <ol> 
  <li>Access multiplayer.</li> 
  <li>Select “Cross-Play”.</li> 
  <li>Select “Create”.</li> 
  <li>Customise your options and select “Launch”.</li> 
 </ol> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <h4>Photo Mode</h4> 
 <p>Position and pose your party, play around with camera settings, and whack a few stickers on there. Photo Mode is now yours to explore with Patch 8!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <h4>Getting Started</h4> 
 <p>To test out Photo Mode, toggle it on or off by pressing down on both analog sticks if on console, or by pressing F9 if on PC. You can also enable Photo Mode by clicking on the Photo Mode icon on the HUD minimap.&nbsp;</p> 
 <h4>Exploring Camera Settings</h4> 
 <p>When you’re adventuring with your party, you’ll be able to alter their positioning and try different facial expressions and poses, while making the most of the camera, lens, and scene settings, even during combat encounters.</p> 
 <p>While you won’t be able to change the position of your party or camera angle during dialogues and cinematic scenes, you will still be able to enjoy a range of post-processing effects, including colour-grading settings, frames, and stickers.</p> 
 <h4>Photo Mode &amp; Modding</h4> 
 <p>Speaking of stickers, Photo Mode already includes more than 300 stickers, but keen modders out there will be able to create and upload their own via the BG3 Toolkit!</p> 
 <h3 class="titlearea">New Subclasses</h3> 
 <p>One new subclass for each playable class is now available, featuring new abilities, animations, VFX, unique summons, powerful cantrips, and voiced dialogue for the Oathbreaker Knight for those playing as the Oath of the Crown Paladin subclass!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Packed with new ways for you to play, whether you want to roleplay the God of Thunder by using Elemental Cleaver, imbuing your Path of the Giant Barbarian’s hammer with shocking damage and flinging it out for it to come back to you, or as a drunken monk, with truly homebrewed abilities that will enhance your next playthrough, there’s surely a subclass for you!</p>

 <h3 class="special">Baldur’s Gate 3 Modding</h3> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit</h3> 
 <p>As well as Patch 8, the Baldur’s Gate 3 Modding Toolkit is receiving an update, which means mod authors will now be able to explore partial level editing! Whether you fancy creating your own NPC, dropping a metric ton of carrots across every existing level just for the sake of it, pledging your undying love to Shadowheart by turning all wolves into bunny rabbits or by moving them to the House of Hope, you’ll now be able to use the Toolkit to add or override certain template types in existing levels.</p> 
 <p>Partial level editing means that what you won’t be able to do with the official Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit is add dialogues or change the static parts of the world like buildings, scenery or terrain. You can, however, create your own interactive objects like a chest that teleports away every time you get close to it - no one will touch your belongings ever again! Including you. Or you could make a salami statue that you can put in your pocket. The world truly is yours.</p> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">Modding Guidelines Update</h3> 
 <p>To support the new realm of possibilities with the latest Toolkit update, we have now updated the modding guidelines with new information, and will continue curating mods for console. As part of this update, we have reviewed technical requirements, and unfortunately, mods that introduce new playable races are unable to be curated for console. If you’re a mod author, we suggest giving the guidelines a read by&nbsp;clicking here.</p> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">UI Functionality Improvements</h3> 
 <p>We have been continuing to work closely with mod authors to ensure there are fewer conflicts between game mods and new patches, particularly for those that have ImpUI as a dependency. While the ImpUI mod isn’t currently being maintained, to help keep things running smoothly and to support the creative passion of those in the modding community, we’ve introduced minor changes to how some functionalities are handled in the Toolkit. Now, mod authors will be able to make changes directly for mods that rely on UI tweaks during Character Creation.</p> 
 <p>The changes now supported natively in the Toolkit include:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Action Resources</li> 
  <li>Racial spells at LevelUp</li> 
  <li>Race passives</li> 
  <li>UI scrolling for Heads, Passives, Equipment, Class, Subclass, and Origin selection</li> 
  <li>Feat passives</li> 
  <li>Radial customisation and descriptions</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Thank you to&nbsp;Djmr&nbsp;for their incredible work on this mod and for keeping in contact with us while we resolved the conflicts and introduced this functionality, as well as&nbsp;Caites, both who have been particularly helpful, and whose names now lie firmly in the Baldur’s Gate 3 game credits, along with the mod authors who have been helping us test Toolkit functionality!</p> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">Mods In Patch 8</h3> 
 <p>As Patch 8 begins to roll out, please remain patient and respectful of those in the community who put work into creating their mods. Some things might not work immediately after a new update and it might take a little while before a mod can be updated. If you can’t wait to dive in but are worried about your mod list, we recommend starting a new playthrough to enjoy the new subclasses and to try out photo mode.</p> 
 <h2 class="titlearea">Patch Notes</h2> 
 <p>Along with the new additions, Patch 8 also tackles a range of bugs, like fixing Shadowheart’s penchant for hair dye while skinny dipping, Cerys will stop getting involved in combats with Minthara from across the region, and we’ve resolved an issue with the moving platform in the Gauntlet of Shar that has accidentally proven harder to survive than, well, the actual Gauntlet of Shar.</p> 
 <p>SPOILERS - Please bear in mind some of the entries below might contain spoilers, proceed at your own risk&nbsp;</p>

  <li>Fixed some issues with Uncanny Dodge: it will now trigger correctly, it will no longer trigger multiple times per round, and rogues can no longer somehow still use it even if they're Incapacitated.</li>

 </ul> 
 <p>Act III</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>In the Knights of the Shield combat, the Gate Masters will no longer bring reinforcements after the portals are closed. The infinite supply of githyanki spawning from nowhere was a little disconcerting.</li>

  <li>The 'Summon Us' item is no longer tradeable.</li>

  <li>Greater Invisibility stealth checks now get progressively harder in Honour Mode.</li>

  <li>Fixed a potential soft-lock where using a melee attack on something in the environment that's too high to reach (like a wall turret or a dangling cocoon) could block your movement until the action was interrupted.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue causing the Attack of Opportunity arrow to not be visible on Mac.</li>

  <li>Fixed the screen turning black for several long seconds on multiplayer when a dialogue is interrupted by another player's action.</li>

  <li>Fixed the environmental fading system (that makes walls fade out so you can see through them, for instance) not working properly when loading a split screen savegame created while in Turn-Based Mode with the players on different floors.</li> 
  <li>When playing on split screen, if the screen is merged and one player moves to a different terrain level, it would cause the ground to fade and appear invisible for the other player, making it hard to navigate. The game will now dynamically split the screen if both players are on different floors or there's enough of a terrain height difference between them.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where hurling a healing potion as a rogue in what is presumably an attempt to heal a target would trigger Sneak Attack and sometimes damage or even kill the target.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a potential bug causing the class names in dialogue options being replaced with 'Rare' when loading a savegame.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug causing targets of the Seeming spell to briefly appear naked or have invisible equipment.</li>

 <ul> 
  <li>Fixed an issue in a particular corridor in the Crèche that could cause the camera to turn black when enabling Tactical View.</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug causing Fighters to appear unarmed when starting a new game.</li>

 </ul> 
 <p>Act II</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>You'll now need to deal with a healed Ketheric &amp; Co. if you Long Rest during the assault on Moonrise. The passage of time heals all!</li>

  <li>You should no longer get stuck in combat on the roof of Moonrise Towers if there aren't any enemies left.</li>

  <li>Fixed a missing screen fade when transitioning to the Upper City region on split screen.</li>

 </ul> 
 <p>FLOW AND SCRIPTING</p> 
 <p>Across Acts</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where ignoring Gale and his mirror image at camp would lead to his double hanging around in the morning.</li> 
  <li>Saved some players who were stuck sleeping at camp.</li> 
  <li>Fixed some repeating overhead dialogues across the game to reduce combat log and audio spam.</li> 
  <li>Fixed Gale's body not moving at all while he delivers a line about Voss.</li> 
  <li>Jaheira no longer trades items at camp as though she's a merchant while she's still in the party - this led to strange interactions at camp. If you engaged in trade with her and left items on her, you can get them back by just taking them out of her inventory the normal way.<br>Fixed an issue with the Shadowheart vs Lae'zel fight night where the defeated character could still survive the night and would hang around without being able to join the party.</li> 
  <li>Fixed some cases where the night would literally never end (careful what you wish for) because a party member not in the active party was in a dialogue while everyone else was snoozin'.</li> 
  <li>Fixed some characters who were stuck in Wild Shape form.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a dialogue flow issue where asking Shadowheart about the fight with Lae'zel would make her talk about Astarion. Focus, Shadowheart.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a case where the non-summoned version of Scratch had no dialogue at camp. Balance is restored.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue where some of Shadowheart's incurable wound flare-ups would block later flare-ups, blocking off some later content.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where Origins that were resurrected for camp nights during region transitions and died outside of camp were not sent back to camp.</li> 
  <li>Fixed Sceleritas sometimes referring to the Dark Urge using the wrong pronouns when talking to other party members. Also fixed him sometimes repeating his lines.</li> 
  <li>Fixed companions talking about being in the swamp from Act I even if they're not. It's rude to call people's homes 'stinking swamps', Astarion.</li> 
  <li>Gale should no longer tell you to join Elminster at camp if you're already at camp.</li> 
  <li>You no longer need to interact with Nightsong and Isobel at the end of Act II to receive their Gather Your Allies ability.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a voice line not being audible when the cursed monk possesses the corpse of Shirra Clarwen.</li> 
  <li>Fixed some cases where the cursed monk inhabiting the amulet would fail to comment on certain areas while the amulet is equipped.</li> 
  <li>Fixed the game displaying an empty Strength check in the dialogue that happens after you use Heal on the Dark Urge.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a multiplayer issue where if one avatar had enough approval with a companion for a romantic scene to trigger but wasn't available for it, and none of the others had enough approval, the romantic scene would still trigger.</li> 
  <li>Gale will no longer demand to eat your magical trinkets if you don't even have him recruited to the party.</li> 
  <li>Minthara no longer insists on repeating herself about the Emperor's illithidity.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where being spotted by a guard while committing two crimes at the same time, with one crime being trespassing, could lead to a soft-lock. For example, a Wyrm's Rock prison guard could spot you in a forbidden area immediately after you destroyed the door leading to the main part of the prison.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Act I</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Shadowheart should no longer bang on the chapel door while talking. That's manners.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue where you wouldn't receive the locket from Arabella's parents after dealing with the Shadow Druids.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where approaching the goblins at the windmill with a non-avatar character would cause both avatar and companion to be addressed. This could unnecessarily cause combat to ensue.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug causing Shadowheart to appear dead when loading older saves should she have been killed in the showdown with Lae'zel. This fix prevents the bug from happening in new playthroughs.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where if you killed Gekh, then used Glut's Animating Spores to resurrect him, then dismissed Glut, both Spore Servant Gekh and Glut could become hostile towards you. It would also cause Gekh to try to stop you from using the raft to cross the lake.</li> 
  <li>Fixed multiple Oath of Vengeance dialogue options not appearing in Act I dialogues.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug allowing Glut to travel outside the Underdark if you used a waypoint from within the camp. Back in your cave, Glut.</li>

  <li>Sceleritas will no longer refer to your artful handling of the poor bard's carotid artery if you didn't 'take care' of her yourself.</li> 
  <li>In rare cases where the illusion concealing the true nature of the hag's servants is broken but the illusion concealing the general area is not, the dialogues will now reflect that.</li> 
  <li>Interrupting Nere's dialogue after rescuing him from the cave-in should now correctly cause him to become - and remain - hostile when necessary.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where talking to Baelen for the first time while he's in the middle of picking up his backpack could cause him to not teleport beyond the bibberbang field. If this already happened to you, you'll need to talk to him again to make him go to the Myconid Village. He's forgetful, you see.</li> 
  <li>Fixed the goblins from the Goblin Camp sometimes joining combat in the Emerald Grove when they shouldn't.</li> 
  <li>Meli now actually pickpockets Barth.</li> 
  <li>Removed a particular overhead line in the Adamantine Forge that suggested the hammer was just starting to move when it, in fact, had just stopped moving.</li> 
  <li>The healing potion Auntie Ethel gives you in the Emerald Grove now correctly applies the healing effect.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue where Sovereign Glut could join the party as follower after being killed and refuse to leave.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug that was preventing Wyll from commenting on the fact Astarion held a blade to your throat during Astarion's recruitment dialogue by the beach.</li> 
  <li>Halsin is a little more reliable when it comes to joining you at camp when he says he will.</li> 
  <li>The sleeping bugbears in the Goblin Camp will now more consistently react to you choosing to attack them via the dialogue UI.</li> 
  <li>Fixed Auntie Ethel's double sometimes appearing again after her death. Surprise!</li> 
  <li>Lae'zel will no longer name-drop Ketheric before he's ever mentioned when you speak to her after meeting Voss at camp.</li> 
  <li>Raised the attitudes of some characters from the Emerald Grove when Minthara is defeated.&nbsp;</li> 
  <li>Sazza will now walk off near Priestess Gut when you save her by killing Minthara and her would-be executioner.</li> 
  <li>Added a missing dialogue option to leave the dialogue with Bex and Danis a little earlier if their repulsively adorable chatter about getting a pet is too much for you.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a multiplayer issue where instead of Lae'zel confronting the avatar that goes inside the cave in the Astral Prism, the game would incorrectly choose Lae'zel's avatar instead of her for the dialogue, resulting in a buggy dialogue between two avatars.&nbsp;</li> 
  <li>Sazza will now follow another character if the character she was already following is dismissed to camp.</li> 
  <li>The hag will no longer start her menacing speech if she spots someone in her lair while someone else is close enough that she won't be able to finish the speech due to combat triggering.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a soft-lock where you could get stuck in the Enclave Library if you sent the Key of the Ancients to camp.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where unlocking the Emerald Grove Environs waypoint before triggering the cinematic at the front gate of the Emerald Grove would cause Memnon and Arka to forgo mourning Kanon.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a duplicate dialogue option about the grove being nature's beating heart when talking to Halsin.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug causing three of the goblins at the Goblin Camp to get stuck in front of the Collapsed Corridor instead of following all the other goblins to the Emerald Grove.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug causing Sazza to get stuck cowering after battle is over.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Act II</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Hostile Last Light Inn residents will now become neutral again when the hostility is caused by an erroneous reaction to Minthara.</li> 
  <li>Added some fallbacks so you can still confront Oliver after destroying his Nightdome even if you and/or Oliver are Silenced.</li> 
  <li>Shadowheart will no longer immediately turn hostile and act like you committed a crime in the Shadowfell if you tell her 'You want to fight?</li> 
  <li>Fine.' While she's not afraid of a good brawl, she'll finish saying what she has to say first.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a dialogue option specific to sorcerers in the conversation with Dolly Thrice causing the Moonlantern to not work.</li> 
  <li>The Moonlantern crafted at Moonrise Towers will now protect you from the shadow curse as intended.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue where attempting a skill check against Kar'niss could occasionally cause the dialogue to end abruptly.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue causing avatar Origin characters in a party with a Dark Urge character to potentially turn hostile along with other companions during a Dark Urge event at night in Act II if the Dark Urge character fails to persuade them that they are not responsible for the murder. Also fixed avatars that were broken in this way, including dead avatars that can't be resurrected.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue where a dead Shadowheart could still trigger a dialogue at camp with Nightsong.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a rare bug where being arrested by the marching army when trying to get to Baldur's Gate for the second time could lead to player characters who were present during the first arrest, but not during the second arrest, to still be teleported into the prison cell in Moonrise Towers.</li> 
  <li>Minthara will now continue to want to speak to you after you tell her to wait.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue where sending Gortash's Netherstone-Studded Gauntlet directly to camp instead of picking it up wouldn't give you his Netherstone until you went back to the Traveller's Chest and retrieved the gauntletfrom it. Now sending the gauntlet to camp results in you getting his Netherstone immediately to prevent you from losing track of it.</li> 
  <li>Minthara and Halsin will now more consistently choose to remain in the Shadow-Cursed Lands when you load into another region.</li> 
  <li>Z'rell will no longer fail to do her duties - namely fighting back when she's attacked - when she's in her office.</li> 
  <li>Characters at the bazaar at Moonrise Towers will no longer continuously catch unwelcome visitors and leave it up to the guards to determine who's welcome and who isn't.</li> 
  <li>Fixed His Majesty and Thaniel sometimes becoming hostile under the wrong circumstances.</li>

  <li>ixed a bug where the surviving Harper scouts could sometimes turn hostile at Last Light if their leader died fighting the drider.</li> 
  <li>Fixed your character addressing Shadowheart after deciding Nightsong's fate when Shadowheart isn't there.</li> 
  <li>Minthara's Speak With Dead dialogue options now make more sense if she dies in Act II before joining the party.</li> 
  <li>A certain plaque in the Thorm Mausoleum now correctly mentions who the coffin belongs to.</li> 
  <li>Party members will now comment on the area below Moonrise Towers if they fall through either entrance in the prison.</li> 
  <li>Fixed one of Karlach's lines not playing when you talk to her when entering the Colony in Act II.</li> 
  <li>Fixed the cutscene for deciphering one of the Engraved Githyanki Discs not triggering.</li> 
  <li>Prevented Minthara from being replaced in her escape-from-Moonrise dialogue by an avatar or another character.</li>

  <li>Fixed companion Shadowheart not interjecting with Shar-related lines in an endgame dialogue.</li> 
  <li>If you're playing as Karlach, you'll no longer miraculously come back to the Elfsong after burning out or going to Avernus after defeating the Netherbrain when you have multiple romantic partners.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug causing you to get stuck in the Elfsong camp.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a flow issue where if Halsin was your romance partner and you chose to go with him at the end of the game, during the epilogue he would act as though you didn't.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a wrong check issue that would prevent Shadowheart from saving her parents if given the opportunity.&nbsp;</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where Scratch could escape the kennels by the Sword Coast Couriers through the power of fetch. Look, a bug is a bug, okay?</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue where, on some older savegames, Kith'rak Voss would not be present in the Sewers in Act III.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a rare case in which unconscious characters would get stuck in permanent combat with the turrets in Ramazith's Tower that would never kill the character, preventing the portal connected to the shop from opening again, which in turn cut off characters outside of the tower.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where Orin's version of the Netherstone dagger failed to swap to the player version of the dagger when you equipped it directly from her corpse in a specific circumstance.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue where Flaming First Madigan could get stuck in an infinite dialogue loop, desperately trying to send you back to prison.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a flow issue in the Investigate the Murders quest where some players had their quest log update to say they'd learnt the passphrase to enter Candlehallow's Tombstones even if they hadn't. We've reverted this quest step update so you can continue the quest as normal.</li> 
  <li>You no longer need to manually progress with spacebar or mouse or by pressing 1 to continue through Karlach's scene in Avernus with Wyll.</li> 
  <li>Fixed the cinematic where Minsc bursts out of a mimic not starting when you enter the vault shapeshifted.</li> 
  <li>Fixed Minsc getting stuck in the Counting House vaults.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a flow issue where if you were playing as Gale and you didn't become the God of Ambition, you could still find yourself looking and acting pretty godlike in the epilogue.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an un-interactable Oskar recovering from unconsciousness after a Long Rest before Kerri's portrait is destroyed if his possessed condition was removed using the Protection from Evil and Good spell.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause Zanner Toobin to just stand in the doorway to the Steel Watch Foundry if you walked out of the building while he was your follower. He will now always return to the office and wait for you to come back. Guess he likes it in there.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a very rare bug where you could break up with your partner but still be unable to date Halsin.</li> 
  <li>If Allandra concluded the funeral and returned to her office, the waveservants will no longer stop you if you want to finish the 'Avenge the Drowned' quest.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug causing Ravengard to die when exiting Wyrm's Rock Fortress after loading a save in which he was broken in a very specific way. Note that if he had died as a result of this bug he will not be resurrected when loading this patch.</li>

  <li>Fixed Halsin repeatedly bringing up Astarion's relationship with him in overhead dialogues under certain circumstances.</li> 
  <li>Roger Highberry will no longer follow Cora's corpse to mourn in front of it if you move it outside the boundaries of the wine festival. This will prevent Roger from, for example, appearing at your camp if you move Cora's corpse to your Traveller's Chest.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an overhead dialogue about Gale triggering even if he's not in the party.</li> 
  <li>The courier informed us that he found a lost letter from the Grove that was meant to arrive at an important party. It's now been sent on its rightful way.</li>

  <li>When talking to Jaheira about her Rite of the Timeless Body, you could tell her your race lived longer than hers, regardless of facts or logic. Now this only applies if your race does, canonically, live longer.&nbsp;</li> 
  <li>You can now ask Barkeep Severn about Cheeky Nora after the Guildhall coup is resolved.</li> 
  <li>There were two copies of Taming Hope: Part Two in the House of Hope. The second copy of that book has now rightfully been replaced with Taming Hope: Part Three.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a rare case where Yurgir wouldn't appear in the House of Hope, which could lead to you not being able to leave the House of Hope after combat.</li> 
  <li>In the cinematic with Beorn Wunterbrood at High Hall, Jaheira or Halsin will now speak up before Withers does when appropriate.</li>

  <li>Fixed the duel between Sir Penghyst and Lord Jeth triggering twice if you choose to attack them both via the dialogue.</li> 
  <li>Other characters should no longer show up during Gale's contemplations about surviving the end of Act II after departing.</li>

  <li>Ringmistress Lucretious may now join your fight against 'Dribbles' &amp; Co. at the circus.</li> 
  <li>Animal tamers at the circus should no longer open the beast cages before the clown joins the fight. The beasts used to just run away without their leader in combat.</li>

  <li>Fixed a Perception check that could let you spot a key inside Crimson Draughts through the roof.</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug preventing your kuo-toa allies from showing up in the endgame.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Journal</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>The journal will now close the 'Free the Artist' quest after you defeat Kerri and will no longer will tell you to go get a portrait from Oskar if he and Jannath split up, since he won't make one in that case.</li>

  <li>The Bulette has a new condition called Diamond Scales and a new Legendary Action called Shredding Scales.</li>

  <li>Added a new aura and spell for Spectators: Panicked Sentinel and Ocular Nightmare, respectively.</li>

  <li>Ch'r'ai Har'rak, the githyanki leader at the Knights of the Shield Hideout, has a new Legendary Action called Tu'narath's Embrace.</li> 
  <li>Ptaris has a new Legendary Action called Ptarian Dogma.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">UI</h3> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Updated the Reactions UI so that you only have to toggle the Reactions you want to use and then confirm them. (This saves you from having to select 'Do not react' multiple times!)</li> 
  <li>Added a new Equipment Options menu to the Character Sheet on controller.</li> 
  <li>The panel that opens to 'Donate' magic items to Gale will now also show items in your Traveller's Chest. It also now indicates which items are currently equipped.</li> 
  <li>We noticed some of you hiccoughing bubbles, so the action for washing yourself with soap and sponges is now called 'Use' instead of 'Consume'.</li> 
  <li>Fixed your player character's name getting reverted to 'Custom' during Character Creation if you moved on to create your Dream Guardian and then went back to edit the player character again.</li> 
  <li>Fixed the wrong spell Ability showing up when selecting a Feat during Level Up.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h3>Art</h3> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Added a new loading screen in Act III, showing the busy streets of Baldur's Gate.</li> 
  <li>Fixed the skirt part of the Adamantine Splint Armour missing for female dwarves.</li> 
  <li>Fixed the Adamantine Scale Mail clipping on large male characters.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">Gameplay</h3> 
 <ul> 
  <li>You can now start Custom Mode games using Honour Mode mechanics when starting a new playthrough. You'll be able to do this via the 'Ruleset' dropdown.</li> 
  <li>The kuo-toa that promised to build you an army will now support you in the final battle. Unless they all died in Act I.</li> 
  <li>The help that the Gondians promised for the final battle will now arrive in the form of a friendly Steel Watcher. Apologies from Zanner Toobin for the delay.</li> 
  <li>The hair colour options in Character Creation will now remain accessible after you choose the bald hairstyle, so that you can continue fiddling around with eyebrow colours.</li> 
  <li>Overhead dialogues that support multiple player characters can now involve characters assigned to different players. (They were limited to characters controlled by a single player until now.) This means that there will be more banter among player characters in multiplayer games.</li> 
  <li>Group Hide will no longer affect summons that aren't linked to the group in the Party Line.</li> 
  <li>Changed the behaviour for selecting camp supplies for a Long Rest. When selecting camp supplies that are stacked, the game now only takes what it needs from the stack.</li> 
  <li>You can no longer cheese the Leap of Faith trial at the Gauntlet of Shar by just clicking the final platform and letting your character pathfind their way there. Shar threatened to smite us if we didn't fix this one.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where resurrecting Lae'zel on the beach in Act I would cause her to appear in the Party Line but not in the world, preventing you from leaving Act I.</li> 
  <li>Patched up some savegames where Gale still had his Necrotic Aura when he shouldn't on load.</li> 
  <li>Fixed Minthara's body sometimes turning invisible on the Level Up screen. (We sorta liked the floating-head-and-hands look, but hey.)</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">Animation</h3> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Astarion now has idle animations at camp that aren't just him reading a book.</li>

  <li>Karlach will no longer brush the shaved side of her head.</li> 
  <li>Polished the appearance of neck kisses in lovey-dovey scenes with Shadowheart on the Sharran path for characters with large body types and dragonborn characters.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">Writing and Flow</h3> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Dotted some dialogue options and voiced lines into a handful of dialogues across the game, particularly to account for edge-case flows. These changes are described in more detail in the main patch notes below.</li> 
  <li>Added three new Narrator lines for Dark Urge characters to add a bit more reactivity across the game. These additions are described in more detail in the main patch notes below.</li> 
  <li>Resolved an issue that had been rendering some romance party banters inaccessible while adventuring.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a flow issue where Avatar Lae'zel did not have the option to leave and ascend or stay on Faerûn after the Netherbrain is defeated.</li> 
  <li>Added a dialogue option asking for a kiss in more paths of Wyll's epilogue dialogue.</li> 
  <li>If you're in holographic form in the epilogue, Wyll won't automatically assume he's talking to Lae'zel.</li> 
  <li>A bug that had been preventing Wyll’s romance greeting from triggering has now been fixed, so players in Act III who have a stable, loving, and committed relationship with Wyll will now see his romance greeting triggering correctly.</li> 
  <li>Fixed priorities on Wyll’s greetings so that low approval greetings will now trigger accordingly for players with low approval.&nbsp;</li> 
  <li>Companions should now be more sympathetic to Astarion fleeing from the sun.</li> 
  <li>Added a new dialogue in which Karlach will react to Dammon if she finds him dead after he told her that he can help her.</li> 
  <li>In Act II, Minthara will now react to you having knocked her out in Act I.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">Scripting</h3> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Fixed several issues (related to resurrecting characters via Withers, restructuring the party at night, and automatic camp night scenes) that would trap you in an eternal slumber, unable to end a Long Rest.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug causing Shadowheart to keep repeating one line when you talk to her after she's resurrected by Withers from the Shadowfell.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a small flow issue preventing you from commenting on Gale's last name.</li> 
  <li>Fixed several occurrences of Wyll still having an exclamation mark above his head when he already told you everything he had to say.&nbsp;</li> 
  <li>When playing as the Dark Urge, Minthara will no longer act as though you accepted Bhaal when you've been stripped of his influence.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a broken kissing scene after you gave Shadowheart the Idol of Shar.</li> 
  <li>Fixed an issue where Jaheira would stop following the party after spending a night outside of the party.</li> 
  <li>Fixed the rune tablets on the nautiloid sometimes not triggering the Narrator's lines.</li> 
  <li>Clerics of Lathander should now recognise his symbol on a Lathanderian amulet.</li> 
  <li>Ensured the avatar is prioritised as the main speaker in dialogues related to the hag's Act I surrender.</li> 
  <li>Minthara does, in fact, now have something to say about Orin after you kill her.</li> 
  <li>Made the romance scene at night with Wyll in Act III unskippable if it triggers to avoid accidentally skipping it and not being able to finish the romance arc.</li> 
  <li>If Avatar Karlach and Wyll are partners and go to the Hells together, he'll now act accordingly during the epilogue.</li> 
  <li>Fixed Karlach's scene in Avernus not playing if you decided to go with her when playing as Wyll.</li> 
  <li>A bug has been fixed so that Wyll will now talk to his father if Ansur is defeated after the pact with Mizora is broken but Ravengard is saved from the Iron Throne despite this, to decide on his title.&nbsp;</li> 
  <li>Lae'zel will now wait a little longer for you at the site of her recruitment if you tell her you'll be back.</li> 
  <li>Improved Lae'zel's idle camp behaviours to align a bit better with the other companions'.</li> 
  <li>Fixed the fade-to-black after Karlach's scene in Avernus at the end of the game, which would give you a very brief glimpse of Game Developer Land.</li> 
  <li>Breaking up with Karlach by speaking with another companion you're dating the morning after her romance scene won't block her dialogue anymore.</li> 
  <li>Reinstated Gale's last line in his detailed explanation of ceremorphosis and tweaked a dialogue option to react to it.</li> 
  <li>Now that you can give Gale magic items from the Traveller's Chest, he will leave again if you refuse to do so.</li> 
  <li>Patched up some savegames that had a bug that would prevent the dialogue between Gale and Mystra at the end of the game from triggering.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug that let you kiss Gale even if he was in a disguised form before confronting the Netherbrain.. Also fixed this dialogue with him cutting off before you could give him a smooch.</li> 
  <li>Reworked the script that determines whether a character is too busy to talk. This will prevent bugs like Minthara's dialogue not triggering at Moonrise Towers after you rescue her, and knock-on effects as a result of this, like not being able to rest or fast travel.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">Performance</h3> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Continued to make performance and stability optimisations across the game and implemented many under-the-hood code fixes.</li> 
  <li>Optimised performance. This will have a more noticeable impact in areas with large numbers of NPCs (like the Lower City) and will reduce peak memory usage when loading levels for the first time. It will also be noticeable when managing lots of loot (e.g. when transferring everything from a camp chest to a character's inventory).</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">Cinematics</h3> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Reworked and revamped the cutscene that plays when you interact with Ansur's bones in the Wyrmway.</li> 
  <li>Polished facial expressions and emotions across companion dialogues, including to the facial animations of your character during some kissing cinematics, including with the Vampire Lord Astarion.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h3 class="bonfire">CRASHES AND BLOCKERS</h3> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Fixed a crash when loading the Act I region.</li>

    <li>Fixed the Grenade Impellers and Incineration Casters becoming active as soon as Gortash entered combat and leaving combat as soon as Gortash left, even if they were in a different area (Gortash in the Audience Hall, turrets in his office). They no longer depend on Gortash and become active or inactive when a combat nearby starts or ends.</li> 
    <li>Fixed Micromodron Force Curtain and Deranged Force Curtain sometimes having two contradictory conditions (Active and Malfunctioning at the same time).</li> 
    <li>Fixed a bug causing the Incineration Casters to be affected by the First Strikes combat penalty (causing them to skip their first turn) the first time they enter combat.</li> 
    <li>Fixed two Incinerator Casters in Gortash's office not working correctly.</li>

  <li>Fixed some technical names showing up for each of Ansur's limbs. Naming them all 'Ansur' was the ansur.</li> 
  <li>Fixed Ansur's friendly Lightning Strike units sometimes attempting to attack the lightning strikes.</li>

  <li>Enemies will now properly drop loot when dying from having one of their ability scores reduced to 0.</li>

  <li>Improved an edge-case quirk of AI spellcasting by ensuring that it has a source and target position before committing to a projectile-based attack.</li> 
  <li>Prevented summons and followers like Glut from being able to consume Noblestalk. Yes, your Mage Hand probably ate it. No, we don't know where its mouth is.</li> 
  <li>Dismissing hirelings or avatars via dialogue now functions the same way as dismissing companions.</li> 
  <li>When Withers resurrects an avatar, the Dream Guardian will no longer immediately prompt another nearby avatar to loot them for a tadpole. Similarly, dead, dismissed avatars will no longer trigger this same prompt. Some decorum, please.</li>

  <li>Dismissing the leader of a party follower will now reassign that follower to an active avatar.</li> 
  <li>You can now swap out party members by speaking to the companion you want to replace even if the one you want to replace them with is Wild-Shaped. What your companion will think of you replacing them with a sheep is another story.</li>

  <li>Summons will now disappear alongside their owners when you dismiss the latter to camp.</li> 
  <li>Fixed multiple spots where Perception checks were being made through solid objects.</li>

  <li>Fixed an issue on multiplayer where Gale would briefly appear to be in his undies for the client if the host has the Donate UI open and Gale is wearing magical robes that he can consume.</li> 
  <li>When you unlock a trapped item using its key, the trap will now be disarmed.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a bug that would let you waltz your way through destructible walls without actually destroying them. (You could attempt to attack the wall and your character would pathfind right through it in search of a comfortable spot from which to take a swing.)</li> 
  <li>Bald characters with the Wet condition will no longer have darker scalps.</li> 
  <li>You can no longer loot the underwear of non-recruited companions when you knock them out.</li>

  <li>Gale no longer has access to Netherese Orb Blast in the Netherbrain's Psyche.</li> 
  <li>Hanged bodies in the Lower City (including Florrick) are less likely to fall down when you meddle with them. Only movement, a change in their type of death (like getting pulverised), or additional physical harm can take them off the gallows.</li>

  <li>Fixed an infinitely looping dialogue in Sorcerous Sundries.</li>

  <li>Avatar Astarion will now correctly roll a passive Perception check to recognise the scar on Sebastian's face.</li>

  <li>Made small improvements and tweaks to Karlach's main dialogue and her epilogue dialogue.</li> 
  <li>Fixed the same dialogue option sometimes appearing twice when talking to Halsin about your adventures in Sharess' Caress.</li> 
  <li>You should no longer potentially see the great empty void of Game Developer Land after starting the epilogue.</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug where it was possible to get stuck in a dialogue with the Emperor about killing Gortash if you clicked on Gortash's corpse with Karlach (which starts a dialogue, after which she leaves the party and goes to camp) while, with another character, you also clicked on Gortash's body and sent his gauntlet to Karlach via the context menu right before her dialogue ended and she left the party. Yep. You can read it again if you want.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a rare issue preventing Ravengard from properly joining combat in the Iron Throne escape sequence.</li> 
  <li>Fixed a flow issue at the end of the game where players with romantic partners would get a cinematic reserved for solo players.</li> 
  <li>Devella will no longer disappear from Figaro's after killing Dolor under very specific conditions.</li> 
  <li>On the Dark Urge's resist-Bhaal path, fixed a rare edgecase where Orin's Netherstone dagger did not appear on her. It should now appear in Orin's gore pile or near the temple altar.</li> 
  <li>You can no longer summon Scratch in the epilogue using Find Familiar. This was preventing you from interacting with him.</li> 
  <li>In the epilogue, Minsc should now account for the edgecase of Happy not being there.</li> 
  <li>Fixed Scratch's spawn point in the Elfsong Tavern camp.</li>

 </ul>
